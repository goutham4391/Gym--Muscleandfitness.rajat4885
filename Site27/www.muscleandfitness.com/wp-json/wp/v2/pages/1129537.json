There are two general categories of cookies: session-based cookies that last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser; and persistent cookies, which last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. Many browsers default to accepting cookies, but you can generally change those settings, as described below in the Opting Out section.<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Cookies<\/h2>\n<p>We may use a variety of cookies in connection with providing you the Services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Essential cookies<\/strong> enable the Services to operate correctly and are generally designed to improve your user-experience. Such cookies also allow you to access to a members-only part of the site or help the content of our site load quickly in your browser.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Functionality cookies<\/strong> allow the Services to remember preferences you have selected, such as login details and other selections you may have made during previous browser sessions. These are designed to make it easier for you to use our site without setting your preferences each time you visit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social Media cookies<\/strong>, which are used in conjunction with social media tools, allow one or more social media networks to record when you have engaged with a social media tool on our site. In some instances, the social network may send us data that you have agreed to share. If you do not want the social media network to share information with us, please check the privacy settings of the applicable social media network.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Advertising cookies <\/strong>allow us to track browsing habits as you visit the site. Based on your browsing history and with our permission, we may use third-party advertising partners who can then display to you a relevant ad when you are on a third-party site such as a social media platform. Within these cookies, we may also encode your precise location, such as latitude, longitude, GeoIP, and\/or other location-specific information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Analytics cookies<\/strong> collect information about who is visiting our site and how users engage with our site. This information does not identify any individual user; it is aggregated and anonymous. Such information may include number of visitors to our site, referring websites, pages visited while on this site, time of day visited our site, new or repeat visitor, and similar information. This information is used to help us understand the usage of our site and to improve the operation of our Services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related Technologies<\/strong>. To help us make e-mails more useful, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities. You can opt out of receiving emails from us as set forth in the Opting Out section below. We might also use pixel tags, which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the site and provide us with information associated with your interaction with the site. These tags may collect the IP address and browser type of your device. Pixel tags are also used by our third parties to collect information when you use the Services, and we may use this information in combination with cookies to display targeted advertisements.<\/p>\n<h2>Opting Out<\/h2>\n<p>Most browsers give you the ability to manage cookies. In some browsers, you can configure rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust. For more information regarding configuring the cookie settings of a particular browser, please see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allaboutcookies.org\/manage-cookies\/\">https:\/\/www.allaboutcookies.org\/manage-cookies\/<\/a>. Please also note that if you limit our ability to track cookies, you will likely reduce your overall user experience and\/or lose the ability to access the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of third-party cookies from Google Analytics.
