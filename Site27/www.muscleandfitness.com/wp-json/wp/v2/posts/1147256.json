But, with so many online \u201cauthorities\u201d touting differing eating windows and methods of fasting, how long should we really aim to be fasting for, and when is the best time of the day to eat? Plus, is it safe to fast as we get older? We talked to Steve Hendricks, author of \u201cThe Oldest Cure in the World: Adventures in the Art and Science of Fasting\u201d to get his take.<\/p>\n<p>Steve Hendricks has studied fasting from both an academic and personal standpoint, even taking up residence in various fasting clinics to gain a rounded perspective. \u201cI\u2019m 52 and I first became curious about fasting in my 30s,\u201d he says. \u201cLike a lot of people, I started putting on weight in my 20s and I was interested in ways to get it off. Fasting isn\u2019t a magic bullet for weight loss but it can be a useful tool. Before finding fasting, I had experimented with simple caloric restriction, which just means eating less each day, but CR is notoriously hard to pull off because of the constant gnaw of hunger.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFasting, I was delighted to discover, as so many people have, is far more doable than CR because fasting actually suppresses hunger. Better still, fasting unleashes many of the same healing mechanisms as CR. Our body is repairing cellular damage all the time, damage that can eventually become disease, but usually these repairs occur only at a very low rate because the body is so busy with other things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/lose-fat\/8-powerful-superfood-combinations-supercharge-your-health\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">processing the nutrients from our meals<\/a>. But when we give the body a break from processing nutrients, it uses the downtime to step up the repairs, helping to prevent disease and giving us an added opportunity to live longer. It\u2019s a marvellous mechanism, honed by at least a billion years of evolution, and we now have some good science to guide us in how to use it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long should we be fasting for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6314618\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Studies have shown<\/a> that even extended fasts of four to 21 days are beneficial, providing cardio vascular protective benefits, fat loss, and emotional well-being. \u201cMost fasting doctors recommend adults do a kind of maintenance fast of 1 or more weeks, once a year, under competent medical supervision,\u201d says Hendricks, who believes that daily intermittent fasting should always include timed calorie restriction for at least 12 hours, in order to receive the benefits. \u201cNot coincidentally, 12 hours is around the point where people tend to start reporting that they are feeling better and have more energy than they did when eating across the whole day,\u201d he says. \u201cWith each hour that you shave off this 12-hour window, the gains to health could increase markedly. Scientists aren\u2019t precisely sure of the ideal eating window, but most seem to think it lies at around 6 hours. Narrowing the window below 6 hours may not be helpful though. If you eat in, say, a 4-hour window, some scientists fear the drawbacks of cramming a whole day\u2019s worth of food into your gut in so little time might outweigh the benefits of a longer fasting period.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><div style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%;\" class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Man intermittent fasting and timing his meals and feeding windows\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">PeopleImages<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Is there an optimal time to eat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s much healthier to organize your eating window earlier in the day,\u201d says Hendricks. \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/workouts\/workout-tips\/feel-rhythm-maximum-energy-endurance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Our circadian rhythms<\/a> have hardwired us to digest food and process nutrients most efficiently in the morning and early afternoon. Evidently, the longer the day goes on, the worse our bodies do at such tasks and there seems to be nothing we can do to change that. So, when we eat in the late afternoon, let alone evening or night, food and nutrients will linger for longer in our gut and blood vessels, where they can do damage. Eating later interrupts many of the cleaning and repair processes that our body undertakes overnight while we sleep, potentially leading to more chances of disease.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe science on exactly when to start your eating window isn\u2019t settled yet, but I think most scientists in the field would say it\u2019s likely to fall about an hour or two after you wake up. For a lot of people, that would mean eating in a window of something like 8am to 2pm each day. I know it sounds crazy to eat dinner at 1.30pm. rather than 6pm. I sure didn\u2019t look forward to doing it when I first tried it, but people who\u2019ve made the switch, including me, report that it turns out to be a remarkably easy change to make after the first few days. If you can\u2019t eat on that sort of schedule for whatever reason, a compromise might be to go ahead and eat dinner at the usual time but keep it light and stack most of your calories at breakfast and lunch.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"7 Super Simple Snacks and Meals\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/foods-leade-568775733.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Hero Images \/ Getty<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Is it safe to practice fasting at any age?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hendricks believes that fasting is something that could be adopted from adolescence onwards, by initially eating in a 12-hour window, but there\u2019s no reason to quit the habit as we age. \u201cMany scientists and fasting doctors have concluded that daily fasting of up to about 18 hours every day is safe and healthy for adults of all ages,\u201d says Hendricks. \u201cThere are so many health benefits from eating in a narrow feeding window; our body-wide levels of inflammation will drop, insulin sensitivity increases, more antioxidants are produced, and greater numbers of worn-out cellular parts are recycled. The ideal age to start is early in life so as to establish daily fasting as simply the normal way that you organise you\u2019re eating.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=82&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Man-Rejecting-Hamburger-Skipping-Meal.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Andrey_Popov \/ Shutterstock<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h2>Tips to get started with Intermittent Fasting<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cIf fasting sounds hard, just go easy at first,\u201d says Hendricks. \u201cIf you\u2019re eating across 15 hours of the day now, you might find it a challenge to drop to 6 hours straight away. Fasting doctors and researchers recommend just knocking an hour off your eating window for a week or so, and once you\u2019re comfortable with that, knock off another hour, then eventually another hour. If you can get down to 6 or 7 hours, great. If that\u2019s too hard for whatever reason, congratulate yourself on eating in whatever narrow a window you can achieve. Any window of 12 or fewer hours will bring you some gains in health.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, don\u2019t let perfectionism get in your way. If you want to go out with friends for a late dinner once a while, it won\u2019t derail you too much, although you\u2019ll probably notice that you feel a little more sluggish the next morning. Similarly, if you did a hard workout in the middle of the day and you realize later that you didn\u2019t eat enough during your eating window, go ahead and eat a little more so you\u2019re not famished all evening and that your muscles have the building blocks to recover with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Oldest-Cure-World-Adventures-Science\/dp\/B0B8T2HKZS\/ref=sr_1_1%20crid=16FNXEGMJ5I9K&amp;keywords=The+Oldest+Cure+in+the+World%3A+Adventures+in+the+Art+and+Science+of+Fasting&amp;qid=1663142204&amp;sprefix=%2Caps%2C429&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Oldest Cure in the World: Adventures in the Art and Science of Fasting<\/a> by Steve Hendricks is out now.<\/p>\n<div class=\"link-related article link-related__with-thumb\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"article__thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/ultimate-guide-intermittent-fasting\/\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"article__figure\"><div style=\"padding-bottom:56%;\" class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=280&amp;h=158&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 280w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=400&amp;h=225&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=560&amp;h=315&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 560w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=600&amp;h=337&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=700&amp;h=394&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 700w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=800&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?w=940&amp;h=529&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 940w\" sizes=\"280px\" alt=\"Man intermittent fasting and timing his meals and feeding windows\" width=\"150\" height=\"84\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Macro-Timing-GettyImages-526249771.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div>\t\t\t<\/figure><\/a>\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article__content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"article__category\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/\">Healthy Eating<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article__title\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"article__title-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/ultimate-guide-intermittent-fasting\/\">The Guide to Intermittent Fasting<\/a>\n\t\t<\/h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"article__subtitle\">Everything you need to know about this diet strategy.<\/p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/ultimate-guide-intermittent-fasting\/\" class=\"article__more\">Read article<\/a>\n\t<\/div>\n\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As science continues to investigate the role that fasting plays on healing our bodies and balancing our bodyweight, it seems ever more likely that putting a timed restriction on our calorie intake has the potential to lower blood pressure and protect us against the aging process.
