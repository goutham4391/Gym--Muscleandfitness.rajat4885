Eight-time Ms. Olympia Lenda Murray was Dennis James\u2019 guest on the roundtable that also included Milos Sarcev and Chris Cormier. The group discussed Murray\u2019s career and some of her friendly rivals over the years, but the topic eventually switched to the stars of women\u2019s bodybuilding today. James asked her if she felt the division was going in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, women\u2019s bodybuilding is going in the right direction, and one of the great reasons why that is the women\u2019s physique division,\u201d Murray answered. She elaborated on why that connection was so meaningful to her.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing women like Sheena Ohlig, Andrea Shaw, the women that were in the top seven were all women\u2019s physique competitors before that were afraid to say they were women\u2019s bodybuilders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of Shaw, James put Murray on the spot and asked her who was challenging Shaw for the Ms. Olympia title this year. Shaw explained that the challenge for Shaw isn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cwho\u201d but a \u201cwhat\u201d on her own physique.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you turn around to the rear, and you have someone like an Angela Yao or a Mona Poursaleh that are so conditioned, if they are close together, the judges may see Andrea\u2019s glutes and want to see more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cormier follows women\u2019s bodybuilding closely as well, and he feels confident in Shaw\u2019s chances of three-peating on the Olympia stage.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think she\u2019s at the place where all she has to do is be in shape and it will go in her favor,\u201d he advised.<\/p>\n<p>Murray, Sarcev, Cormier, and James talk about a lot of topics, including memories with Joe Weider, debating Haney vs. Coleman, and a lot more.
