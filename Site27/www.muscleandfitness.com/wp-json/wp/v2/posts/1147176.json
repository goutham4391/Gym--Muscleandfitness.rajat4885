And if only it was that easy. During pregnancy, the body undergoes massive changes as it makes room for carrying a baby, causing muscles, ligaments, and tendons to stretch and loosen. This physical change can be hard to experience as you may feel weakness where there was strength and instability where there was strong stabilization.<\/p>\n<p>The great news is, that during the fourth trimester, there are key moves you can do to strengthen your pelvic floor and restore your core strength and health. And with a little patience, knowledge, and help from a pelvic floor physical therapist, you\u2019ll not only regain your core strength post-baby but just might return to your training routine stronger than before thanks to building a strong pelvic floor.<\/p>\n<h3>Ab Separation &amp; The Pelvic Floor Explained:<\/h3>\n<p>Diastasis recti \u2013 the dreaded abdominal muscle separation in the front of the core is feared by many expectant mothers. Thankfully, \u201cDiastasis recti is normal, and it doesn\u2019t mean your abs are ruined,\u201d says Rachel Trotta, NASM-certified personal trainer, specializing in women\u2019s fitness, prenatal and postnatal, nutrition, and therapeutic exercise.<\/p>\n<p>During pregnancy, the core tends to become stretched and separated. As the pregnancy progresses and the baby grows, the abdominal muscles are in a habitually lengthened and weakened position. \u201cSimilarly, the pelvic floor (which is the muscular base of the abdomen, attached to the pelvis), comes under stress,\u201d says Trotta. \u201cMonths of carrying extra weight \u2014 not to mention labor itself \u2014 puts pressure on the hammock-like muscles of the pelvic floor.\u201d She explains.<\/p>\n<p>Since the core and pelvic floor are hugely responsible for everything from balance to being able to hold your pee, things are going to feel a little \u201coff\u201d when a new mom returns to exercise. \u201cSomething as small as sneezing or as unexpected as stepping off a curb can trigger urine leakage, and either end of the spectrum \u2014 overdoing it, or not exercising at all \u2014 can encourage symptoms like pelvic pressure or lower back pain,\u201d says Trotta.<\/p>\n<p>More good news: With proper attention during the postpartum period, you can not only recover completely, but come back stronger, faster, and fitter than ever!<\/p>\n<h3>The Best Postpartum Exercise: Single-Leg Exercises<\/h3>\n<p>Single-leg moves, also called unilateral exercises, are moves in which you either balance on one leg or one leg is pulling most of the load. Trotta loves single-leg work for postpartum women for three reasons:<\/p>\n<ol><li>Using one leg at a time imitates common, functional movements \u2013 like kneeling to pick up your baby, climbing stairs, or even stumbling and catching yourself. You need balance and coordination for real life.<\/li>\n<li>We tend to have a \u201cfavorite\u201d side, and this habit will only be accentuated during the postpartum period when you will find yourself holding your baby more often on one side. Doing single-leg exercises helps to even out muscular imbalances and prevent resulting discomfort (like back pain).<\/li>\n<li>Single-leg exercises give your body a unique challenge that helps to strengthen your abdominal and pelvic muscles postpartum. Using only one side of your body demands more balance and stability from your core muscles, which means your core and pelvic floor will recover faster and smarter. No more leaks!<\/li>\n<\/ol><h2>5 Postpartum Exercises To Avoid<\/h2>\n<p>While all women are unique in their recovery journey, it is generally advised to avoid the following exercises and other similar exercises until at least six weeks postpartum\u2014sometimes even later:<\/p>\n<ul><li><strong>Planks<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Pushups<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Situps<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Crunches<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Leg Raises (from your back)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\u201cThese moves create a high amount of what\u2019s called \u201cintra-abdominal pressure,\u201d which can adversely affect diastasis recti recovery, pelvic floor coordination, and wound healing in the early postpartum period,\u201d says Trotta.<\/p>\n<p>Although many women are technically cleared by their obstetrician to resume exercise at 6 weeks, Trotta encourages her postpartum moms to consider this a time for rebuilding, not picking up where they left off pre-pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of jumping into a vigorous exercise routine (even jogging) to lose weight, Trotta likes to frame the \u201cfourth trimester\u201d as a time to strengthen the pelvic floor, rebuild the core, and prevent urine leakage.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><div style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%;\" class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Female fitness group performing postpartum exercises and workouts for their hormones\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Female-fitness-group-performing-postpartum-exercises-and-workouts.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Photo by bruce mars on Unsplash<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Incorporating Postpartum Exercises into Your Lifestyle and Workouts:<\/h2>\n<p>(Keep in mind, if you had a C-section, you\u2019ll need to get official clearance from your doctor before doing any type of exercise.)<\/p>\n<h4>Weeks 1-2<\/h4>\n<p>For the first two weeks, Trotta highly recommends new moms avoid any formal exercise and simply focus on recovering, taking short walks, and getting to know their new baby. \u201cTake advantage of floor time with your baby to do belly breathing exercises, easy stretches, and mobility exercises\u201d says Trotta.<\/p>\n<p>This period is also a fantastic time to build a relationship with a pelvic floor physical therapist, who can give you personalized exercises to promote pelvic floor recovery. Here, Trotta shares a quote from an experienced pelvic floor physical therapist, Kim Breslin.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhether a woman births a baby vaginally or via C-section, she will absolutely benefit from seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. The body goes through major physical changes during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and deserves special attention when healing postpartum. There is no one-size-fits-all exercise for healing the pelvic floor (Kegels are not the answer!) but seeing a specialist can help solve tricky symptoms like bladder leakage, prolapse, abdominal separation, or pelvic pain that can be a barrier to resuming workouts.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Weeks 2-6<\/h4>\n<p>Before you are formally cleared to exercise, you can begin re-strengthening your muscles and support your recovery by continuing your breathing exercises and adding lots of stroller walking and careful stair-climbing (in real-life situations, not at the gym). You can also practice your single leg strength with:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Quadruped leg extensions<\/li>\n<li>Standing from half kneeling<\/li>\n<li>Stroller walking uphill<\/li>\n<\/ul><h4>Weeks 6-12<\/h4>\n<p>At this point, many women are cleared for formal exercise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInstead of jumping right back into a running or HIIT class routine, incorporate single-leg exercises like these into moderate workouts to gradually rehabilitate your core and pelvic floor,\u201d says Trotta.<\/p>\n<p>For each move, start with 8 reps per side, and progress to 20 reps per side.<\/p>\n<ul><li>Single-leg sit-to-stands<\/li>\n<li>Single leg bridges<\/li>\n<li>Bodyweight split squats<\/li>\n<li>Side-lying leg lifts<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Practice doing these exercises with proper breathing, allowing the pelvic floor to relax between each rep. \u201cEven though you may be feeling the urge to \u201ctone\u201d or \u201cflatten\u201d your postpartum core, I would continue to discourage direct ab workouts, running, and high-intensity training.\u201d Recommends Trotta.<\/p>\n<h4>Weeks 12+<\/h4>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve cleared \u201cthe fourth trimester,\u201d you\u2019re significantly recovered and can most likely resume your regular workouts and incorporate many ab exercises with good breathing and control. \u201cBut stay on the lookout for concerning symptoms like urine leakage, pelvic heaviness, or abdominal \u201cdoming\u201d when you sit up \u2013 gradual increases in intensity can help prevent pelvic floor dysfunction, even if you\u2019re itching to jump right back into your regular routine.\u201d Warns Trotta.<\/p>\n<p>More advanced single-leg postpartum exercises Trotta recommends at this point include:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Weighted single-leg deadlifts<\/li>\n<li>Skipping<\/li>\n<li>Pistol squats<\/li>\n<li>Reverse lunge to single-leg jump<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>The postpartum period is not a time to be inactive, but it\u2019s also wise to adopt the mentality of \u201cpracticing slow to progress fast.\u201d It\u2019s not a time to push yourself, but instead, to lay a foundation of solid fitness, breathing coordination, and core strength that will both tone your abs and boost your athleticism for years to come.<\/p>\n<div class=\"link-related article link-related__with-thumb\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"article__thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/muscle-fitness-hers\/hers-athletes-celebrities\/10-fit-moms-who-made-amazing-body-transformations\/\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"article__figure\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=280&amp;h=158&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 280w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=400&amp;h=225&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=560&amp;h=315&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 560w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=600&amp;h=337&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=700&amp;h=394&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 700w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=800&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?w=940&amp;h=529&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 940w\" sizes=\"280px\" alt=\"Mom Bods: 10 Women Who Transformed Their Body Post-Baby\" width=\"150\" height=\"84\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/mom-bods-transformation-promo0.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/figure><\/a>\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article__content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"article__category\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/muscle-fitness-hers\/hers-athletes-celebrities\/\">Hers Athletes &amp;
