Here&#8217;s How to Still Eat Healthy Without Missing Out"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Vacations are meant for lots of fun, not strict dieting or driving yourself crazy with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/lose-fat\/complete-guide-calories\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">calorie counting<\/a> while dining at new restaurants. On the other end of the spectrum, falling off the wagon during your getaway so badly it takes weeks to beat the bloat and button your jeans is not the way to go either.<\/p>\n<p>With that said, there are plenty of ways to stay on track nutritionally while enjoying new foods and indulging for the fun of it. Here, Ashley Craft, author of the<a href=\"https:\/\/ashleycrafted.com\/about-me\/\"> USA Today<\/a> bestseller <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1507218214?tag=simonsayscom\">The Unofficial Disney Parks Cookbook<\/a> offers her best tips on how to eat clean while traveling about and not missing out.<\/p>\n<h3>Pack Clean Snacks<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/11-best-snacks-crush-your-cravings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Having clean snacks readily available<\/a> (especially when traveling), strengthens your line of defense against binge eating due to an unpredictable schedule. \u201cSome ideas for clean snacks would be nuts or dried fruits since they are super packable, or some little beef sticks are great too,\u201d says Craft. If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to pack your own snacks, you may be surprised that certain vacation destinations like Disney, offer a lot of clean eating options at many of their stands and food establishments. \u201cMost stands that sell ice cream bars or popcorn, also sell pieces of whole fruit, so be on the lookout for that when vacationing,\u201d she adds. When it comes to hydration, many destinations provide free cups of water in case you left your bottle back at the hotel.<\/p>\n<h3>View Restaurant Menus Online Before Dining Out<\/h3>\n<p>Dining at new restaurants is exciting and should be stress-free when it comes to enjoying new foods. Simply pulling up the restaurant menu before arriving will help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">navigate what foods you\u2019re looking to enjoy<\/a> and what you may want to steer clear of. Most menus have nutrition facts as well as allergy warnings.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a great resource when ordering food at a Disney Park is to pull up the menu on your phone and scroll down to the bottom.\u201dFor most menus, \u201cAllergy-Friendly\u201d choices are listed and often include clean foods like roasted carrots, fruit salad, or brown rice,\u201d says Craft. You can choose these items as your side instead of the typical fries or mashed potatoes. If you\u2019re eating at a counter-service place, the choices might be more limited, but almost always there will be a salad instead of fries or something similar. The objective is to remove last-minute stress by possibly having to make quick ordering decisions when selecting meals.<\/p>\n<h3>Enjoy Dessert but Use Portion Control<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to eating something sweet while dining out, it can be hard to find clean or light desserts almost anywhere, in that case, \u201cYour best bet is going to be portion control,\u201d says Craft. This way you get to enjoy rich foods on your getaway without going overboard or feeling deprived.<\/p>\n<p>Splitting a dessert with a family member or friend will allow you to sample delicious desserts without experiencing a sugar hangover. (Or regret).<\/p>\n<h3>Try These Clean and Tasty Recipes at Home (or when visiting Disney)<\/h3>\n<p>A few of Craft\u2019s favorite clean dishes shared from her book, \u2018<a
