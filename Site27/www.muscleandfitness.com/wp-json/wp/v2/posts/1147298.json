With this in mind, M&amp;F takes a closer look at this apparel to see if it\u2019s up to spec.<\/p>\n<p>Brady Brand\u2019s new training set is comprised of a long-sleeved hoodie and pair of pants with the purpose of beating the elements on the field while looking sharp for your next workout, wherever that may be. Both garments feature a signature grid texture and offer clean lines and a simple, classic look, but how do they differ from every other training set out there? One of the key benefits of \u201cGrid Flex\u201d is the water-resistant exterior, meaning that rain won\u2019t stop play, but don\u2019t worry about getting too hot because the fabric has a woven construction designed to regulate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/workouts\/workout-tips\/5-tips-cold-weather-training\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your body temperature<\/a>.

This feature is a great way to keep hold of your keys, gym membership card, or AirPods without them flying out of sight the next time you go into a hard tackle or perform the perfect box jump. Colorways include \u201cInk\u201d which looks like it is pretty close to black, \u201cStone\u201d which is a blue-greyish variation, while \u201cFlint\u201d is the lightest shade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Retail Price:<\/strong> $125<\/p>\n<hr><h3>The Grid Flex Pant<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><div style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%;\" class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"The Grid Flex Pant\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Grid-Flex-Pant.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Brady Brand<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Brady Brand says that these are the perfect pants, designed to keep your performance high no matter the weather. Like the hoodie, they offer a water-resistant exterior and added comfort via a fleece lining. Also similar to the hoodie is the thought that has gone into keeping your belongings secure. There is a zippable back pocket, and that\u2019s not something you see with track pants very often. In general, we\u2019ve found Brady gear to be pretty true to form when it comes to sizing, but a generous elasticated waistband should accommodate even the biggest gym giants and defending monster men.<\/p>\n<p>Available in the same colorways as the hoodie with Ink, Stone, and Flint options.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Retail Price<\/strong>: $125<\/p>\n<hr><h3>Grid Flex: The Verdict<\/h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><div style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%;\" class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=82&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=55&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=40&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=40&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=40&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=40&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=40&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Grid flex material from Brady Gear\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Grid-flex-material-from-Brady-Gear.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Brady Brand<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>If you like your training clothes to be loud and proud, you may find Brady\u2019s activewear a little tame for your tastes, but the purpose of the classic look is to provide a line of apparel that can be worn for both work and play, and that\u2019s something we appreciate. The subtle textured pattern that appears on these \u201cGrid Flex\u201d garments makes them a little different from the norm, without being too bold.
