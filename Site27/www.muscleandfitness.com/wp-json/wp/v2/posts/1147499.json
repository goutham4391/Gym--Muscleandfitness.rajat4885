Still, if you\u2019ve read anything about caffeine (a natural stimulant found in coffee beans), you\u2019d know that opinions vary wildly, with some quarters lauding it for its performance boosting potential, and others decrying it with claims that caffeine causes dehydration. Ahead of National Coffee Day on Oct. 1.<\/p>\n<p>M&amp;F talked to Dr Neil Clarke, an Associate Professor in Sports Science from the <a href=\"https:\/\/pureportal.coventry.ac.uk\/en\/persons\/neil-clarke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centre for Sport, Exercise and Life Sciences at Coventry University, England<\/a>,\u00a0to filter out the fact from fiction.<\/p>\n<h3>Caffeine and its relationship with performance<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cCaffeine is frequently taken by professional and amateur sports people in an attempt to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/features\/active-lifestyle\/9-tools-help-you-recover-smarter-and-make-serious-gains\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">facilitate improved performance<\/a> during a wide range of activities such as intermittent exercises like football, and racket sports such as badminton. It is also used for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/workouts\/full-body-exercises\/8-outdoor-moves-burn-fat-and-build-endurance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">endurance exercises<\/a> like running and cycling, and resistance exercises including weight lifting,\u201d Clarke says.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40279-018-0939-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent meta-analysis<\/a> reported that caffeine has a small but obvious improvement on endurance when taken in moderate doses of 3 to 6 mg\/kg body mass, as well as an increase in mean power output (3%) and time-trial completion time (2%).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, in tennis and golf, caffeine ingestion has been shown to increase hitting accuracy and overall playing success, possibly due to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4663\/4\/3\/45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improved reaction time and mental alertness<\/a>. \u201cHowever, the evidence for caffeine ingestion during sprint exercise is less convincing,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cBut, it still shows that sprints lasting up to 3 minutes show limited improvements with caffeine use. And, in events lasting around 10 seconds, ingestion was shown to improve peak power output, speed, and strength.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Focused muscular fitness model doing a barbell bicep curl exercise as part of his supersets workout\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Focused-Guy-Barbell-Bicep-Curl-.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Lebedev Roman Olegovich<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><h3>Caffeine and its relationship with cognition<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cIn addition to the well-established ergogenic effect of caffeine on physical performance, caffeine ingestion can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3049131\/pdf\/1550-2783-8-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve cognitive performance<\/a>, especially in those who are sleep-deprived,\u201d says Dr Clarke. \u201cFor example, caffeine doses of 1 and 5 mg\/kg body mass alleviated the decrements in performance during a repeated rugby passing drill in elite rugby players following sleep restriction. In virtually all studies of capacity, where caffeine has been employed, the \u2018Rated Perceived Exertion\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.2165\/00007256-200737030-00002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scores are lighter when compared with placebo groups<\/a>. In sports such as tennis and golf, <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/26285020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ingestion has been shown<\/a> to increase hitting velocity and accuracy, and overall playing success, possibly due to improved reaction time and mental alertness.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Caffeine and Dosage<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/nutrition-and-healthy-eating\/in-depth\/caffeine\/art-20045678\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Mayo Clinic\u00a0says<\/a> that daily dosages totalling up to 400mg appear to be safe for most healthy adults. That\u2019s around 4 cups of coffee per day. Still, as relates to performance, going above 300mg per day may impair your performance rather than aid it. \u201cPossibly due to increased muscle tremor and postural sway,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cLow doses of caffeine, less than 3 mg\/kg body mass of caffeine are ergogenic and are associated with few, if any, side effects, although this area has been less well studied.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLarger caffeine doses above 9\u00a0mg\/kg body mass\u00a0do not appear to increase the performance benefit and are more likely to increase the risk of negative side effects, including nausea, anxiety, insomnia and restlessness. \u201cConsequently, the majority of the research on caffeine to date typically focuses on the ingestion of 3 to 8 mg\/kg body mass.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Caffeine and its relationship with fat loss<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cStudies in the late 1970s reported that caffeine ingestion can increase the mobilization of fatty acids, which when released from adipose tissue, is transported to the muscle and possibly used as fuel,\u201d Clarke says.<\/p>\n<p>The relationship between caffeine and fat loss is still being studied today, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/12\/12\/3603\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent meta-analysis<\/a> concluded that a pre-exercise intake of a moderate dose of caffeine may effectively increase fat utilization during submaximal aerobic exercise when performed after a fasting period. \u201cFor example, a pre-exercise intake of 3 mg\/kg body mass increased fat utilization from approximately 19 grams an hour with a placebo, up to 25 grams for the group ingesting caffeine, when <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33025051\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">both groups undertook an hour of submaximal<\/a> cycling,\u201d says Dr Clarke. \u201cSo, it appears that caffeine may boost fat oxidation when ingested before a bout of exercise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, there are a few points to consider. It is important to note that the effects may have been increased due to this exercise being performed with no breakfast, when fat oxidation is naturally higher, and carbohydrate negates the efficacy of caffeine. Additionally, the ability of caffeine to enhance fat oxidation during exercise tends to be higher in sedentary or untrained individuals rather than trained and recreational athletes. Finally, although caffeine ingestion might increase fat oxidation, it needs to be stated that weight loss will only occur when in a negative energy balance where the energy expended exceeds calorific intake.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption \"><div style=\"padding-bottom:55.5%;\" class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Physically Fit Man Sitting On A Yoga Mat Wiping Off Sweat Drinking A Bottle of Water\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Physically-Fit-Man-Sitting-On-A-Yoga-Mat-Wiping-Off-Sweat-Drinking-A-Bottle-of-Water.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Ivan Kruk<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><h3>Caffeine and its relationship with dehydration<\/h3>\n<p>A long-held belief among bro-scientists has always been that drinking coffee may have a diuretic effect, but more recent research is showing this to be incorrect. \u201cThe traditional form of caffeine administration in research and athletic settings has been to ingest tablets or capsules with liquid,\u201d says Dr Clarke. \u201cHowever, there is <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/29140142\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growing evidence<\/a>\u00a0that caffeine administered in alternative forms, such as coffee,\u00a0when consumed in moderation, contributes to daily fluid requirement and does not pose a detrimental effect to fluid balance,\u00a0especially during exercise. So, drinking coffee can actually help maintain hydration.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Is caffeine safe?<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cThe European Food and Safety Authority\u00a0concluded that \u2018single doses of caffeine up to 200 mg\u2019 (about 3\u00a0mg\/kg body mass) from all sources, do not raise safety concerns for the general adult population. Moderate coffee consumption can be defined as 3 to 5 cups per day,\u201d says Clarke.<\/p>\n<p>Drinking coffee has a broad range of benefits that can improve performance from a physical perspective. These include, but are not limited to; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/workouts\/workout-tips\/10-tips-endurance-training\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improved muscular endurance<\/a>, movement velocity, and muscular strength. \u201cPerformance may also be increase due to the release of endorphins which attenuates the pain sensation and rating of perceived exertion during exercise, decreasing the perceptions of effort,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cIn addition, factors such as improved reaction time, cognition, and mood are also likely to have a positive influence on performance.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>A final thought to go with your coffee<\/h3>\n<p>It has been <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17412475\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well documented<\/a> that there is considerable variation in caffeine content both in terms of concentration and per serve from coffee,\u201d\u00a0 Clarke says. \u201cFor example, the caffeine content of raw Arabica coffee is lower than the Robusta variety.\u201d Then there\u2019s the potential that ingredients added to your cup of Joe may interfere with its benefits. \u201cOne final point about coffee is that the effect of milk on the bio efficacy of caffeine is currently unknown,\u201d says Clarke.<\/p>\n<p>So, when reaching for your next Starbucks, you may want to ditch the cream, and the syrup, and stay in a calorie deficit to get the most out of caffeine\u2019s potential to burn fat and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/7-foods-improve-focus-and-cognition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve physical and cognitive performance<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"link-related article link-related__with-thumb\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"article__thumbnail\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/features\/active-lifestyle\/try-these-cold-brew-coffee-options-and-products\/\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"article__figure\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 150w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=280&amp;h=158&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 280w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=400&amp;h=225&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=560&amp;h=315&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 560w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=600&amp;h=337&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=700&amp;h=394&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 700w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=800&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?w=940&amp;h=529&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 940w\" sizes=\"280px\" alt=\"Cold brew coffee being poured into a cup of ice\" width=\"150\" height=\"84\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Cold-brew-coffee-being-poured-into-a-cup-of-ice.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/figure><\/a>\n\t\n\t<div class=\"article__content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"article__category\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/features\/active-lifestyle\/\">Active Lifestyle<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article__title\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"article__title-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/features\/active-lifestyle\/try-these-cold-brew-coffee-options-and-products\/\">Need a morning Preworkout Kickstart?
