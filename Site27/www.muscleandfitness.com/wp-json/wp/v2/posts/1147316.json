Modern female bodybuilding had only gotten started in 1977, just three years earlier, so this was still an infant sport. It takes several years to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/flexonline\/training\/how-to-build-a-bodybuilders-physique\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build a real bodybuilding physique<\/a>, but none of the first Ms. Olympia competitors had been training seriously for more than a few years, and their training goals and expectations were not that high. They certainly had no muscular female role models to set standards for them to aim for.<\/p>\n<p>In sports, athletes frequently do not achieve certain levels until somebody else does it first. It took a long time for a runner to do a four-minute mile and once that was achieved lots more followed suit. Today, high school runners can have that kind of performance. Gymnasts all did a double-something until one of them was able to do a triple-something. Then, they all had to do it. Golf was considered primarily a \u201cskill\u201d sport until Tiger Woods came along, muscled up, and got everyone else working out in the gym. Now, a lot of pro golfers have physiques that obviously owe a lot to weight training.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1147319\" style=\"width: 1024px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><div class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.36519386835%;\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Rachel McLish Doberman\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Doberman.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"caption\">Rachel and pet Doberman at the pool of her former Rancho Mirage home.<\/span> <span class=\"credit\">Bill Dobbins<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1147322\" style=\"width: 1024px;\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><div class=\"ratio-based-placeholder\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.36519386835%;\"><img src=\"\/wp-content\/themes\/muscle-and-fitness\/assets\/build\/images\/placeholders\/default-muscleandfitness.svg\" data-src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all\" srcset=\"\" data-srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 200w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 400w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 800w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=900&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 900w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1000w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?w=1100&amp;quality=86&amp;strip=all 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"Rachel McLish Olympia Comparison\" width=\"200\" height=\"111\" data-fallback-img=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rachel-McLish-Olympia-Comparison.jpg?quality=86&amp;strip=all\"><\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"caption\">Rachel McLish stands in the lineup of comparisons at the 1980 Ms. Olympia.<\/span> <span class=\"credit\">Bill Dobbins<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/flexonline\/flex-news\/the-evolution-of-female-bodybuilding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bodybuilding\u2019s first Ms. Olympia competition<\/a> did not have much muscle mass by any subsequent standard, so this was mainly a dieting competition.

The women were small but shredded and defined.<\/p>\n<p>Just before the Ms. Olympia competition, there was only one female bodybuilder the public knew anything about: Lisa Lyon. Lisa had been on TV, featured in Playboy, and been the subject of a photo book by renowned photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Lisa was not very muscular or ripped, but she was shapely and athletic. And she was an excellent photo model.
