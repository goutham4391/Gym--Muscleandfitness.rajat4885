										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Considering the triceps muscle makes up two-thirds of your upper arm mass, it’s no secret that <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/arm-exercises/tricep-exercises-anatomy-benefits-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triceps-focused exercises</a> like certain dip variations should dominate arm day. Triceps dips (or bodyweight dips) are a classic, tried-and-tested exercise known for not only adding strength and size to your arms but your chest and shoulders as well.</p>
<p>Without a dumbbell (or a gym) in sight, you can beef up your arms and <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/upper-body-strength-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add upper body strength</a> simply by making dips a consistent part of your exercise program.</p>
<p>Although this move looks easy, (minus the thick chains around the neck of a dip veteran), proper form can take a bit to master and is imperative in avoiding injuries.</p>
<p>When proper form is mastered, dips serve as a much safer alternative to other moves such as the bench press. “Because one moves their body through gravity rather than moving resistance through gravity, dips are actually safer for one’s shoulders over bench pressing,” says Michael Wittig, ISSA CPT, certified nutritionist, and eight-time natural pro champion.</p>
<p>Wittig shares his top tips to help boost your dip experience while keeping bad form and injuries at bay.</p>
<h3>Pain With Triceps Dips – Your Body is Telling You Something</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/6-doctor-approved-tips-training-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you find yourself in pain</a> when performing triceps dips—not the feel-so-good burn we all love but the type of pain you know you shouldn’t push through—the best thing you can do is stop the exercise immediately. Pain can range from not stretching and warming up properly to a possible injury.</p>
<p>“If any movement causes pain stop that movement,” says Wittig. There are always other exercises that can be done and it’s better to be safe than sorry. “If you have chronic elbow issues [or past injuries] do see a physical therapist and wear compression elbow sleeves,” advises Wittig. This will provide support to the elbow area when exercising.</p>
<p>When performing dips, pain can be felt in your shoulders, chest, elbows, and triceps. If you’ve warmed up correctly, stretched, and still feel pain, contact your doctor for further instruction. This is not the time for the <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/take-pain-make-gain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“No pain No Gain” mentality.</a></p>
<p>If parallel bar dips cause you pain at all or are too difficult to execute in proper form. Wittig recommends that you “consider bench dips and even self-assisted bench dips with your feet on the ground and knees bent at a 90-degree angle.”</p>
<p>Simply put, pain is telling you something—listen by stopping the exercise and visiting your doctor if the pain persists.</p>
<h3>Struggling with Dips? Try This</h3>
<p>“Dips require <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/8-compound-moves-building-functional-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a good amount of functional strength</a> to complete enough reps to be beneficial,” says Wittig. He add that there are also a few variations and ways to perform dips. “Some might be confused with the different variations, or just not be strong enough to perform effective repetitions.”</p>
<p>So, when pain isn’t the issue but a struggle to complete the dips with proper form is, there are a few ways to solve this issue.</p>
<p>“If you’re not strong enough [yet] to do bar dips, start with bench dips,” says Wittig.</p>
<p>And if you run into the same situation with bench dips, Wittig encourages you to try the variation mentioned above by placing your legs at a 90° angle with feet on the ground. This will help your upper body slowly and safely build up the strength it needs to keep progressing with different dip variations.</p>
<p>And if you’re struggling with all variations, Wittig recommends staying away from dips entirely and strengthening your triceps by performing Triceps push downs. Eventually, your triceps will gain strength and you’ll be able to move up!</p>
<p>Always talk to your doctor about mobility issues or if you have an injury. Remember to warm up and cool down properly and always listen to your body.</p>
<p>“Because dips are bodyweight movements you can give it another attempt and see if they cause pain,” says Wittig. Keep in mind, Dips are safer than pressing movements. If they hurt to do simply choose another movement that doesn’t cause pain and focus on building strength in those areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merging Veterans and Players (MVP) is an organization that works to bring military veterans and <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/news/10-amazing-sports-comeback-stories-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former professional athletes</a> together as a new team to help with the transition period after the uniform comes off. The organization was founded by renowned sports journalist Jay Glazer, but he has several people working with him to help the cause. One of them is Nate Boyer, who understands the connection between veteran and player very well because he’s worn both uniforms.</p>
<p>Boyer is a retired Green Beret of the United States Army. He served for a total of ten years, half on active duty and the other half as a part of the National Guard. Once he finished Qualifying School, he served for his entire military career as a Green Beret and retired as a staff sergeant. Boyer was originally inspired to join the military in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. Those attacks were what inspired him to start thinking about it, and he finally made the decision in 2004 after he had taken part in a trip to Africa to help refugees.</p>
<p>“I was just blown away by the generosity and how grateful the people were that an American was there to help them. “I wanted to be able to fight for those that can’t fight for themselves and lend my services to anywhere in the world that needed that.”</p>
<p>Because of that choice, he’d follow in the footsteps of both his grandfathers, who fought in World War II. He also has a cousin who received an appointment to the Air Force Academy When Boyer decided to join, the United States were already present in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other places in the world. Being able to play a role in making the planet a safer place was something Nate Boyer felt he not only could do, but he should do.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to be a part of that. I had a lot of friends that signed up, and I felt it was the right time for me.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><div style="padding-bottom:55.5%" class="ratio-based-placeholder"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nate-Boyer-wearing-military-gear-in-front-of-a-humvee.jpg?w=200" alt="Nate Boyer wearing military gear in front of a humvee" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nate-Boyer-wearing-military-gear-in-front-of-a-humvee.jpg"></div><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Courtesy of Nate Boyer</span></figcaption></figure>
<h3>A New World for Nate Boyer</h3>
<p>Boyer’s travels would take him to many different places around the world, such as Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Israel, Greece, Bulgaria, and he was stationed in Japan at one point. He was involved in a lot of important missions and causes during that time. Obviously, he’s proud of his entire career, but there was one moment that still stands out, and that is when he became a Green Beret.</p>
<p>“I remember standing in formation after two years of training. I was pretty sure I made it, but I didn’t know,” said Boyer. “There were Green Berets at graduation, and one of them came behind me and whispered in my ear, ‘Welcome to the brotherhood.’ I remember the chills that went through my body and the pride I felt.”</p>
<p>Nate Boyer would finish his career in the National Guard while he went on to college at the University of Texas. He would put on another uniform while he was in school—a Longhorns helmet and jersey as a part of the football team. At age 29, it could be considered a little late to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/make-fitness-priority-during-your-college-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play college football</a>, especially when you’ve never played an organized down in your life. Boyer didn’t let that stop him from trying.</p>
<p>“I had never played before, and it was a regret of mine growing up,” he recalled. “Worst case scenario, I would get cut and nothing changes. So, I might as well try.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><div style="padding-bottom:55.5%" class="ratio-based-placeholder"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nate-Boyer-holding-the-American-Flag-running-onto-the-football-field.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Nate Boyer holding the American Flag running onto the football field" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nate-Boyer-holding-the-American-Flag-running-onto-the-football-field.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"></div><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Courtesy of Nate Boyer</span></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Learning how to Long Snap on the Fly</h3>
<p>Boyer didn’t get cut. He actually spent time learning how to backpedal and run routes while he was in Iraq, and that diligence paid off. He walked onto the team as a safety, and he became a long snapper during his sophomore year. Boyer started for three years, and he earned multiple accolades, including the 2012-13 Big 12 Sportsman of the Year, and the inaugural honoree of the Armed Forces Merit award. Boyer is most proud of the fact that he could call himself an Academic All-American. He’s grateful for the time he spent on the gridiron in Austin.</p>
<p>“That was very awesome. I was fortunate to have the experience.”</p>
<p>Boyer’s next steps would take him to the NFL. In spite of going undrafted, he was signed as a free agent to the Seattle Seahawks in 2015. He ultimately didn’t make the regular season roster, but he got to take the field in the preseason that led to a moment he is very proud of to this day.</p>
<p>“I was very blessed to have the opportunity with the Seahawks. I only played in one game, but I led the team out of the tunnel while carrying the American flag. I also got to play the entire second half of that game against the Denver Broncos, and I had a good game.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><div style="padding-bottom:55.5%" class="ratio-based-placeholder"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nate-Boyer-running-on-the-football-field-giving-low-fives.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Nate Boyer running on the football field giving low fives" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nate-Boyer-running-on-the-football-field-giving-low-fives.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"></div><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Courtesy of Nate Boyer</span></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Nate Boyer Found a New Mission in Life</h3>
<p>Nate Boyer didn’t play at all that season. He received calls the following offseason, but he never made a roster. He opted to move on from football at the age of 35. Around the same time that Boyer was contemplating his future, the opportunity to join Glazer and start MVP arrived, and they made the most of it.</p>
<p>“We cofounded MVP on Dec. 7, 2015. December 7th was the same day as Pearl Harbor Day in 1941. We’re closing in on our 7th anniversary, which we’re pretty excited about.”</p>
<p>The overall mission of MVP is to help both combat vets and former pro players find new purpose and identity, which is very important because both groups associate themselves with their uniforms because it is an extension of themselves and their missions while wearing them. The importance of being able to move forward with a new chapter of life can’t be expressed enough.</p>
<p>“The No. 1 thing that both the vets and players miss is the locker room and the guys,” Boyer noted. “Aside from the mission and purpose, they can’t find that comradery anywhere else.”</p>
<p>Boyer shared that the bond they miss is because of the fact that players went through training camps and seasons with other players, including setbacks, losses, and injuries. The military members go through all of that and so much more simply because of the level of commitment they make to country. The work that MVP is doing not only helps both groups establish new connections, it is playing a positive role in the lives of the people they work with and their families.</p>
<p>“That’s what MVP was born out of. It’s that belief that there’s a lot more in the tank and more great things we can do, but we need to find like-minded individuals that have experienced what we experienced.”</p>
<p>MVP has eight chapters across the country as well as a virtual chapter that veterans and former pros can join to continue MVP’s mission.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Success isn’t always imminent in the IFBB Pro League. Some athletes have to grind for a long time before they finally achieve their first victory, if they get it at all. Women’s Physique competitor Jeannie Feldman had been a pro since 2016, and competed every season since, but never tasted victory.</p>
<p>Then 2022 came, and she finally emerged victorious at the Tampa Pro. She had actually competed at the Olympia before, but she had got in on points. This is the first time that Feldman will enter the Olympia as a champion. She was the guest on a recent episode of Femme Flex Friday, and she told Lenda Murray and Alina Popa that the moment was very special for her.</p>
<p>“I’m over the moon about it,” said Feldman. “Finally, I got my day.”</p>
<p>The Women’s Physique division is deep with incredible athletes, and Feldman is well aware of that because she’s faced many of them in her career. She came close to winning several times, including placing second at Tampa in the past. Feldman expressed that inching closer and closer was what kept her going when many others may not have.</p>
<p>“It was always right there. So, I knew I could not give up because it was right there. I just had to come in better, work harder, and I knew I was going to get my win at one point or another.”</p>
<p>Murray noticed that Feldman had competed numerous times in previous seasons, but this year she waited to make her season debut until the Tampa Pro. She asked Feldman what the strategy was behind that change.</p>
<p>“I decided to take more time and not do as many shows because I saw it was definitely taking a toll on my body,” she said. “By the time I got to the Olympia, I wasn’t looking the way I wanted to look.”</p>
<p>Now that she is qualified thanks to winning a show, she won’t have to compete again until the Olympia in Las Vegas when it takes place Dec. 16-18. To learn more about Feldman and what she has planned for the Olympia as well as her story leading to this point, subscribe to the Wings of Strength YouTube channel to see the full episode of Femme Flex Friday. Episodes are also available at <a href="http://www.wingsofstrength.net">www.wingsofstrength.net</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Lauren’s professional career and personal development has amounted to a life-changing series of teachings that has garnered more than 1.7 million book sales and continues with the release of the highly anticipated “Strong and Lean;” offering up valuable training sessions that can be undertaken in just nine minutes with <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/home-work-no-equipment-home-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no equipment necessary</a>.</p>
<p><em>M&F</em> talked to the military veteran to find out why bodyweight training is so useful. He also shared one of his premium workouts so that you can try it out for yourself.</p>
<p>Lauren is respected internationally as a bodyweight training expert. While serving in the Air Force and later with the Special Operations community, he adapted many of the brutal workouts that he had been subjected to while serving his country, in order to make them accessible for individuals at any stage of their fitness journey. Lauren furthered his career as a physical trainer and thanks to his efficient, results driven approach, he found himself in charge of about a thousand SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets, Force Recon, and Air Force Commandos. For this trainer, a program based purely on bodyweight was shown to be as good as any gym (and having competed as a bodybuilder, he would know).</p>
<p>There are no excuses not to train with your bodyweight in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/125078719X/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Lauren’s book</a> The “Strong and Lean” program takes away any excuses not to train because you only need 9 minutes and a desire to build muscle and burn fat. “The benefits include increased mobility, coordination, and strength,” says Lauren. “Injury resistance and fundamental athletic ability are developed. Your joint alignment is also improved by training your posture, joint functions, helping you to control weight shifting.” Indeed, aside from getting in shape, bodyweight training really is great for mobility, especially as we age. “You need mobility to get into the right positions, and you need strength of stability to stay there,” says Lauren. “That skillset is either getting better or it’s getting worse.”</p>
<p>So, no matter your fitness level, bodyweight training is a great way to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/7-winning-strategies-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve your physical prowess</a> at any age, but why? For Lauren, the principles of “Posture”, “Tight Core,” and “Slow and Controlled” are reoccurring themes that form the basis of the most effective bodyweight sessions, as he explains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Posture:</strong> “Posture refers mainly to the alignment of your spine. ‘Strong and Lean’ improves performance and stress tolerance by getting you into a ‘neutral’ joint alignment, so you can absorb force safely and efficiently. In other words, I make you strong while also making you long and straight!”</li>
<li><strong>Tight core:</strong> “Bracing your midsection protects the alignment of your spine, getting you into better, more effective positions, and then challenging your ability to stay there, which requires core stability.”</li>
<li><strong>Slow and Controlled:</strong> “Real athletic ability comes from being able to position properly. Your task is to perform increasingly difficult movements with better and better joint alignment. You have to focus and move with awareness. Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.”</li>
</ul>
<div class="iframe-wrap"></div>
<h2>Mark Lauren’s ‘Strong and Lean’ 9 Minutes Bodyweight Workout</h2>
<p>“I have hundreds of unique workouts at <a href="https://ondemand.marklauren.com/browse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Lauren on Demand</a>,” says the fitness guru. “For the nine-minute workouts, I like to use the military call signs that I used as an Air Force Combat Controller. I use light-hearted names like ‘Gonzo,’ ‘Beaker,’ and ‘Pickle’ for the easier workouts designed to build the user’s athletic foundation. Give GONZO a try. It’s a floor space only workout that uses one exercise from each of the following movement categories: Floor Exercises, Mobility Exercises, and Standing Exercises.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gonzo (3 rounds):</strong> Perform each move for 45 seconds. Rest for 15 seconds between each exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Bent-leg Bridge:</strong> 2 reps on each leg, then switch. Exhale as you raise your hips. Keep your hips up, as you switch sides. This Floor Exercise improves posture by strengthening your core, while improving shoulder mobility and control of hip rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Starfish Drop: </strong> From the starting position of a pushup, roll your heels left then stretch your right arm to the sky, then return to a pushup position by rotating your hips. Perform a pushup and switch sides. This Mobility Exercise strengthens the entire upper body and core, while improving rotation around the spine as well as lateral flexion and extension of the spine.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom Squat Kneeling:</strong> With your arms out into a “T,” step forward with the left leg and then the right leg. Now, step back with the left leg and then the right leg. Reset while kneeling and reverse the order. This Standing Exercises strengthens the hips, legs, and spinal erectors, while improving mobility and control of weight shifting. Keep your hips low and your chest up.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Modification to make the Bottom Squat exercise easier: Hold your arms out to the front, instead of the “T” position to add more weight to your front.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“The Menace Podcast” is normally a great show to find out the latest news and opinions on men’s bodybuilding, but this week was all about the ladies. Eight-time Ms. Olympia Lenda Murray was Dennis James’ guest on the roundtable that also included Milos Sarcev and Chris Cormier. The group discussed Murray’s career and some of her friendly rivals over the years, but the topic eventually switched to the stars of women’s bodybuilding today. James asked her if she felt the division was going in the right direction.</p>
<p>“Yes, women’s bodybuilding is going in the right direction, and one of the great reasons why that is the women’s physique division,” Murray answered. She elaborated on why that connection was so meaningful to her.</p>
<p>“Now we’re seeing women like Sheena Ohlig, Andrea Shaw, the women that were in the top seven were all women’s physique competitors before that were afraid to say they were women’s bodybuilders.”</p>
<p>Speaking of Shaw, James put Murray on the spot and asked her who was challenging Shaw for the Ms. Olympia title this year. Shaw explained that the challenge for Shaw isn’t necessarily a “who” but a “what” on her own physique.</p>
<p>“When you turn around to the rear, and you have someone like an Angela Yao or a Mona Poursaleh that are so conditioned, if they are close together, the judges may see Andrea’s glutes and want to see more.”</p>
<p>Cormier follows women’s bodybuilding closely as well, and he feels confident in Shaw’s chances of three-peating on the Olympia stage.</p>
<p>“I think she’s at the place where all she has to do is be in shape and it will go in her favor,” he advised.</p>
<p>Murray, Sarcev, Cormier, and James talk about a lot of topics, including memories with Joe Weider, debating Haney vs. Coleman, and a lot more.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living an anti-sitting lifestyle is difficult and sometimes you cannot get away from work or have no time to train before or after work due to early mornings, late nights, or a lack of energy. You go straight from the car to the office chair, back to the car, and home to bed or the couch.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of sitting, which can harm our health and posture. There was a line of thinking a while back that <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/active-lifestyle/stand-strong-work-longer-healthier-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sitting was the new smoking</a>. The thought may be a bit extreme, but sitting too much does have a significant effect on your health. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20650954/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A 2010 paper by the American Cancer Society</a>, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, said that women who were inactive for six hours a day were 94% more likely to die of complications from obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Plus, men who were inactive for six hours per day were 48% more likely to die than their standing counterparts.</p>
<p>Pretty damning, right? But wait, there is more. Sitting too much during your workday may cause sucky posture too.</p>
<h3>THE THING ABOUT POSTURE</h3>
<p>Sitting too much during your workday and looking at your cellphone, tablet, and computer while working are the leading causes of the dreaded text neck (forward head posture) and the rounded shoulder look. Trust me when I say this is not anybody’s best look.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/6-tricks-improve-your-posture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When you’re in this posture</a>, without going to the gym or sitting up regularly, the upper back muscles become weak and inhibited, resulting in a loss of strength and mobility in the upper body. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30112389/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies have shown</a> that forward head and rounded shoulder posture is linked to tension headaches and decreased lung capacity, which can cause problems with inhaling and exhaling air.</p>
<p>Granted, this doesn’t happen overnight, but it is something to keep in mind when sitting too much and you’re too busy to go to the gym. This is when you need to bring the gym to you.</p>
<h3>WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL WITH STANDING MORE AT WORK?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24532996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A study</a> by Carrie Schmitz, senior manager at Ergotron, claims that if you stood instead of sitting for an extra three hours a day, you could burn over 30,000 calories in a year—or about eight pounds of fat. Not too shabby for just lifting your butt out of a chair.</p>
<p>Standing more at work helps your core strength, posture, and balance but don’t go crazy. Standing too much can lead to leg fatigue and lower back problems because gravity constantly acts on the spine.</p>
<p>So, let’s combine the calorie-burning power and health benefits of standing with a routine that will keep you on the straight and narrow when you haven’t time for your usual workout.</p>

<h3>THE ANTI-SITTING WORKOUT ROUTINE TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR OFFICE CHAIR</h3>
<p>Using your body weight and maybe adding a resistance band or two that you can stash in your desk, you can get a short workout while garnering a few weird looks from your co-workers. Don’t worry about what they think because you are being awesome and proactive with your health.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple warmup you can perform at your desk, wearing your work clothes if you wish.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Warmup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crocodile breathing:</strong> 6 reps</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Lie facedown with your hands underneath your head. Breathe deep into your belly and exhale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadbug:</strong> 6 reps</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Lie on your back with knees above hips and hands above shoulders. Extend right leg in front and left hand behind while breathing out. Then repeat this on the other side and keep alternating for 6 reps on each side.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hip extensions with reach:</strong> 5 reps on each side</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Lie on your back with your feet on the floor and arms by your side. Perform a hip extension and reach with your right hand to the left-hand side of the floor. Then come down and up again and repeat the reach on the other side.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six-point rocking:</strong>10 reps</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Begin on your hands, knees, and toes with your head up. Rock your butt to your heels and then back to the starting position. Repeat for 10 reps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Half kneeling hip flexor stretch:</strong> 30 seconds on each side</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Begin in half kneeling position with the knee underneath the hip and the ankle underneath the knees. Squeeze your butt, breathe normally for 30 seconds on each side, and repeat on the opposite side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin Crompton, 51, had <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/fitness-essentials/try-these-7-essential-tips-to-run-a-smarter-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never ran a full marathon</a> before taking the plunge on October 2nd and participating in the 2022 TCS London Marathon. It was an experience that turned out to be one of the most challenging, and exhilarating moments of his life. Now, this visually impaired fundraiser is on a mission to encourage the community to become blind runners and get involved with running, and spread the message of how fully sighted people can get involved too. M&F talked to the inspirational athlete to find out more.</p>
<p>“It’s been on my bucket list since 1989,” says Crompton, who is from Morecambe, England. “I never got around to entering it, or doing anything about it, and then I restarted running last year. Catherine, my sighted guide said to me, the day before applications closed ‘how do you fancy doing the London Marathon? I said, ‘yeah why not’ so we put our name in the ballot.” He decided to raise money for <a href="https://www.galloways.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galloways</a>, his local sight loss charity, via a <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/kev-catherine-lm2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Giving donation page</a>.</p>
<p>Having been granted entry into one of the world’s most famous marathons (26.2-miles / 42.2km), Crompton knew that his experience in London would be much different to that of the majority of other participating athletes. “I was born with an eye condition called retinitis pigmentosa,” he shares. This is a disease that affects the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye. “It got worse over the years, and now, I’ve got no vision in my left eye and I’ve got less than 2% in my right eye.”</p>
<h3>Training for any sport is rarely linear</h3>
<p>Crompton undertook a plan to run three times per week in preparation for the marathon but was derailed when he injured his knee while walking one day, when he bashed himself on some bollards. Of course, accidents like this come with the territory for people with visual impairments day in, and day out, so he soon got back on track. The runner was then given the exciting news that he would finally be given a guide dog, and so he was required to train for six weeks in order to bond with his new companion. Finally <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/routine/workouts/workout-routines/marathoner-ryan-halls-muscle-building-joint-strengthening-legs-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returning to marathon training</a>, Crompton had only covered a half marathon 13.1 miles (21.1km) before the full one arrived. Still, he gave it his all. “I thoroughly enjoyed it, to be honest with you,” says Crompton. “It was difficult, I think, due to the masses of people. People in front of me would cause me to put my breaks on a little bit, because I couldn’t see them coming across, so I couldn’t anticipate it, but the smells, the atmosphere, the crowd, the music… It was phenomenal. I’ve got goosebumps now just thinking about it!”</p>

<h3>Sighted guides are game changers for blind runners</h3>
<p>Crompton ran the marathon tethered to his sighted guide, Catherine, and regularly trains with another friend and guide, Ricky. If you are a keen runner and would like to become a sighted guide, a quick google search will bring up an application process in your local area. You can then be matched-up with a visually impaired running partner. Sighted guides are a resource than offer hope so that blind athletes can participate in an activity that they love. “I was constantly asking Catherine, ‘are we ok’,” says Crompton, describing the London Marathon run. “Catherine was constantly pulling me left, right, or straight forward, and (verbally) cueing me in, checking behind and checking forward. She needed eyes on the back of her head!” he laughs.</p>
<p>Crompton trusts both Catherine and Ricky implicitly, and has built up these partnerships through short runs, all the way up to marathon level. Still, running a marathon as a blind person is a serious quest. Not being able to see things coming up ahead often means that he has to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/tips-first-time-obstacle-course-racers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react sharply when obstacles approach</a>. This didn’t halt Crompton however, and he is already planning to enter future marathons. Learning from the London experience, the runner says that he’ll now build mobility exercises into his training to deal with those obstacles better next time around. “I think lunges and exercises for your hips and legs would give you that extra support and strength,” he says.</p>

<h3>Don’t let visual impairments get in the way of a love of running</h3>
<p>“Do it, because it’s such an amazing experience,” says Crompton. “If you can, and you like running, just go for it, and do it. The crowds are shouting your names and calling for you. It was such an amazing boost.” In recent years the London Marathon, and its sponsors have made great strides to help all types of people feel included in the proceedings. In a world first, sports retailers; Wiggle and New Balance brought specially created braille banners to the event in partnership with the <a href="https://www.rsbc.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal Society for Blind Children</a>. The banners, placed between miles 20 and 23 included motivational messages like “This is Your Race” and “Get a Wiggle On” just when the blind runners needed them most. “I thought it was a really great idea, and a nice way to be inclusive, I enjoyed going over and having a feel of the banners,” he says, finding the initiative to highly motivating.</p>
<p>For Crompton, the physically challenging moments were often offset by the surrealness of the race itself, where both regular runners and blind runners regularly opt to wear costumes to raise awareness for various charities. “I think one of the funniest moments was when we saw a Minion having to be given water because he couldn’t get his arms around the suit,” he laughs. Our man sprinted over the finish line with a more than respectable 6 hours and 3 minutes completion time and was over joyed to find that, just like the banners he had experienced during the race, the marathon medal itself was also given the braille treatment. “Everybody’s medal had braille on it this year,” he says. “It was a real nice gesture.”</p>
<p>So, what did the medal say? “We run together,” shares Crompton.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrea Shaw hopes to finish 2022 with a repeat three-peat. Shaw is both the two-time defending Ms. Olympia and the two-time defending Rising Phoenix Champion. She will look to successfully defend both titles this year. The Rising Phoenix contest will take place in Chandler, Arizona on Nov. 5, and the Olympia will be on the weekend of Dec. 16-18 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Shaw took time out of her prep to visit with Isabelle Turell on the “Fit Rockstar Show,” and she reminisced about her first time stepping onstage at the Rising Phoenix in 2019.</p>
<p>“It was a big deal for me to just do it,” Shaw told Turell. “I was brand new to bodybuilding, and I knew I needed more time to learn how to be in bodybuilding.”</p>
<p>She’d finish seventh in that contest. Helle Trevino won that title. One year later, Shaw would claim the title for herself, and she won the Ms. Olympia that same year – the first time that contest was held since 2014. Shaw is preparing for the new crop of talent that is coming in to face her in both contests, and she shared that she’s excited about the opportunity.</p>
<p>“Loving it,” she emphasized. “I am super excited to see the new ladies on the Olympia and Rising Phoenix stages. It’s going to be exciting.”</p>
<p>Shaw is not only saying that because of the challenges she will face onstage. As an ambassador of her division, she truly wants to see women’s bodybuilding succeed and reach heights it never had before. She’s optimistic when discussing her outlook on the future of the sport.</p>
<p>“I think it’s finally flourishing the way I hoped it would,” she told her fellow bodybuilder. “I still want more ladies to come, but we’re off to a great start.”</p>
<p>Shaw and Turell cover a lot of ground, and you get a rare chance to hear the reigning world champion share her thoughts on a lot of topics. Go to <a href="http://www.wingsofstrength.com">www.wingsofstrength.com</a> and subscribe to the Wings of Strength YouTube channel so you can see this and all episodes of The Fit Rockstar Show. New episodes air every Saturday at 12 Noon Eastern time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the long, hot summer of 2022 quickly turning to a crisp and fresh autumn, many of us are re-thinking our training plan and wondering how to stay consistent in the cold. If you are asking yourself if training in colder climates is OK or questioning whether being of mature age may increase your chances of injuries on the ice, M&F has you covered, and warmly wrapped up. <a href="https://www.hss.edu/rehab-staff_Accetta-Matthew.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Accetta, MS, ACSM-CEP, CSCS *D, CSPS</a> earned a Bachelor of Science in exercise science, and a Master of Science with Distinction, in sports science, through the study of exercise physiology at Hofstra University in Long Island, NY. <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif">Accetta now works at the Hospital for Special Surgery. </span>His expertise ranges from guiding athletes to peak performance, through to providing safe and effective training for those with neurological disorders and special needs.</p>
<p>Accetta is currently certified through the American College of Sports Medicine as a Clinical Exercise Physiologist. Furthermore, he is a <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/interviews/what-it-takes-become-nfl-strength-coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist</a> with Distinction. We asked him for the cold, hard facts, as relates to training in falling temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a good idea to give greater focus to warmups in the colder seasons?</strong></p>
<p>“Warmup exercises, prior to training in the cold weather, provide a great benefit as they increase core and muscle temperature, increase neurological and muscle activation, as well as increase blood flow and oxygen uptake,” says Accetta. “Bodyweight exercises such as squats, walking lunges, high knees, and planks are great to include. These exercises help to raise body temperature, increase range of motion and lower your injury risk.”</p>
<p><strong>What is the ideal clothing to wear for cold training?</strong></p>
<p>“<a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2018/01000/Maximizing_Safety_When_Exercising_in_the_Cold.4.aspx?bid=AMCampaignWKHJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies show</a> that when exercising in the cold <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/feature-gear/5-essential-pieces-gear-cold-weather-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you should wear layers</a>,” says Accetta. “The layer closest to the skin should be tight and moisture wicking… but not too tight that it restricts blood flow. The next layer should provide insulation to preserve body heat. And, the outer-most layer should allow for ventilation and moisture to transfer especially if conditions are windy or raining. Gloves and extra socks should be worn to keep the hands and feet warm. A hat or headband is also a great to keep the heat from radiating and escaping from head and ears.”</p>
<p><strong>Can some medical conditions can be exacerbated by training in the cold?</strong></p>
<p>“Respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are exacerbated by training in the cold, as the cold air constricts the blood vessels in the lungs, disrupting air flow and making it difficult to breathe,” says Accetta. “The cold weather can also exacerbate autoimmune diseases such as MS or Lupus, as the cold places added stress on the body and can lead to difficulty moving the arms and legs, and muscle spasms.”</p>
<p><strong>Are there any common injuries associated with training in colder climates?</strong></p>
<p>“The <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/8-common-workout-injuries-and-how-heal-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most common injuries</a> associated with cold weather training are muscle strains and joint sprains,” shares Accetta. “These often occur when a proper warmup does not take place and the joints and muscles don’t have a chance to regain some elasticity, remaining tight and restricting your motion.”</p>
<p><strong>What would you advise someone who experiences any of these injuries?</strong></p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/stretch-muscle-growth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you experience a sprain or strain</a> while exercising in the cold you should immediately terminate your training session,” says Accetta. “You should give the affected area plenty of time to rest and recover before training again. If the affected area begins to swell you should apply ice in 20-minute increments of 20-minutes on, 20-minutes off. Elevating the affected area is also beneficial to allow the swelling to go down as gravity can help inflammation to leave the affected area. If pain continues to persist, you might want to make an appointment to see a doctor.”</p>
<p><strong>Why are we more prone to injuries as we get older in colder of conditions?</strong></p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/life/decade-by-decade-tips-to-achieve-healthy-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we age</a>, our tendons and ligaments tend to lose elasticity and make strains and sprains more likely to occur by over stretching them, and they don’t have the ability to return to their original length,” says Accetta. “Also, as we age, the ability for the body to maintain core temperature diminishes and so the body has to work harder to maintain homeostasis, this then taxes the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to work harder and deliver more oxygen-rich blood to working muscles.”</p>
<p><strong>How can we continue to train and prevent injuries as we get older?</strong></p>
<p>“A lot of times people don’t allow for ample recovery time between training sessions,” says Accetta. “This can lead to overuse injuries. They often push through those nagging injuries. Also, many times people don’t take the time to warm up and cool down properly.”</p>
<p><strong>So, what are you your “take home” messages for those who want to train in colder climates?</strong></p>
<p>“If you are just beginning a training regimen or haven’t exercised in a long time, it is recommended that you seek out the help and guidance of a health and fitness professional as well as get clearance from your doctor,” says Accetta. “If you are training outdoors on a cold and rainy day, make sure that you wear something that can make you visible to cars and other people passing by, because there may be less light in the evenings or other conditions may make you harder to see. Add reflectors to your bike or wear a high visibility shirt or jacket. It is completely okay to train in the cold as long as the proper measures are taken… make sure that you are appropriately dressed and warm up properly.” Sensible advice! So, the good news is that with a little preparation, and some respect for the elements, there’s no reason to drop your outdoor fitness regime this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karenjeet Kaur Bains is the first Sikh female powerlifter to represent Britain in the World and European championships and lifted gold as a junior at the Commonwealth Championships in 2019.</p>
<p>Now, with a Guinness World Record under her belt, the 26-year-old is trying to take the sport mainstream, and is challenging lifters of all abilities to raise the bar with her online coaching. M&F caught up with the stereotype smasher to find out how she became one of powerlifting’s brightest stars, and how anyone can adopt the <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/6-ways-squat-more-size-strength-and-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic principles of the squat</a>, bench press, and deadlift to strengthen their mind, body, and character.</p>
<p>Bains was born in Warwick, England. Her parents were originally from the Punjab in the North of India, but having moved to England in their younger days the two met, got married, and raised a family; putting their all into making sure that Karenjeet and her brothers had the best opportunities possible. Her parents were proud as punch then, when Bains gained a scholarship and attended Durham University while already dominating the world of powerlifting. As a chartered accountant, Bains is crunching numbers in both the office and the weightroom.</p>
<h3>Karenjeet Kaur Bains smashes the stereotypes</h3>
<p>Having first started powerlifting at age 17, success came quick and was well earned. Bains is a multi-time British, and All England champion, and those victories were in part fueled by closed minded people that often underestimate the potential of a woman in the weight room. It’s a narrative that Bains is working hard to change, and has plenty of her own memories to draw from.</p>
<p>Even as British champion, she recalls entering the gym with her dad, Kuldip, and being approached by an old man who dismissed her straight away, saying that there probably wouldn’t be a dumbbell small enough for her to lift. Kuldip, a <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workout-plan/workouts/workout-routines/6-week-workout-serious-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former natural bodybuilder and powerlifter</a>, came back with the perfect response, telling the unwanted negative voice that “there won’t be a weight big enough!” It was a definitive moment in her life, and reinforced the fact that no one should be allowed to place limitations on your progress because of incorrect perceptions. In truth, there are few men in the gym who can match Bains plate for plate. Eat that, old man!</p>
<p>In school, Bains had already excelled in sports before getting serious about the gym. “I’ve always been very sporty,” she says. “First of all, I did athletics from, say, 5 years of age. My dad is my coach, and coaches me in bodybuilding and powerlifting but he coached me in athletics initially. I’ve got two older, twin brothers, they are 10 years older than me and they used to do (400m) hurdles at national level. When I used to see them doing that, I would learn from an early age what it meant to win.”</p>

<h3>Winning is about forging your own destiny</h3>
<p>Bains is eager to represent her community, and feels that there is not enough South Asian females entering powerlifting. She makes sure to keep her full name announced in interviews and in competitions because “Kaur” is often translated as “lioness,” and is a signifier of being a Sikh female.</p>
<p>Through her success, the proud Sikh hopes to encourage more diverse minorities to enter the sport, and is keen to bring women to powerlifting, from all walks of life. Of course, powerlifting can be an expensive sport when you consider the coaching, gym memberships, and travel required to chase gold, but the Bains family learned to forge their own destiny by keeping things in-house. Her dad’s passion for sports and pumping iron didn’t just catch on with Karenjeet and her brothers, as even mom is also finding success with the hammer throw, discus, and shotput in the masters divisions.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a gym at the bottom of the garden,” shares the lioness. “It’s very old school, with cast iron weights. My dad is an engineer, so he’s made a lot of the weights and everything by hand. There are all these gears, and parts, nothing fancy but I’m always encouraging people that all you need to succeed is grit and determination.” Undoubtedly, powerlifting is one of those sports that gives instant gratification. “I think most newbie lifters kind of get addicted to it,” says Bains. “Because once you lift something, it’s always ‘what more could I lift?’ but when I initially started lifting weights, I had very soft hands and I remember my hands getting ripped to shreds because they weren’t ready. I used to use surgical spirit to toughen up my hands. I think the bench press, deadlift, and the squat came quite naturally to me and I’ve always had very strong legs from years of sprinting and everything else.”</p>

<h3>Karenjeet Kaur Bains shatters world records, and glass ceilings</h3>
<p>In June, Bains became the England Bench Press Champion in the under 69kg (152-pounds) division by raising 95kg (210-pounds). Her personal (raw) bests are 97.5kg (215-pounds) on bench press, 175kg (385-pounds) on deadlift, and 150kg (330-pounds) with the squat. And, while her powerlifting career is riding the crest of a wave, the champ hopes to use this momentum to take the sport mainstream. This inspirational woman us currently fielding television offers and was recently accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records after squatting her own bodyweight of 67kg (147 pounds) for an incredible 42 reps in just 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Powerlifting has provided Bains with an opportunity to see the world. She has competed in countries including England, Canada, Sweden, and Lithuania, but is now hoping to use <a href="https://karenjeetbains.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her online fitness coaching</a> to reach a global audience from her own home or gym.</p>
<p>Bains finds that constantly challenging herself is confidence building, and she is well aware that strength of mind is just an important as strength of body. Through her motivational speaking and panel appearances, through to her one-to-one coaching and regular check-ins with clients on her app, Bains is able to lead by example, noting that she has to push the</p>
<p>boundaries of her mental and physical capabilities just like everyone else. “So, I do the conventional deadlift,” says Bains. “I don’t do sumo, so for me there’s a long range of motion, and I’ve got quite long legs compared to my torso, and I don’t have super long arms, but as soon as I know I’ve lifted the bar off the floor, even just ‘that’ much, I know I’ve got it because I’m a heck of a grinder. I’m very stubborn, and I’m like ‘I’m not letting this go!’”</p>
<p>Bains says that she is keen to put an emphasis on “strong” over “skinny” and points out that her message is not just for wannabe powerlifters. She curates individual training programs for her growing list of clients, who are all at different phases on their fitness journey. Bains is also able to evaluate videos that are sent to her, in order to provide instructions on how to improve on technique, or chat with clients through her online platform in real time through instant messaging.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter your cup size, if your sports bra doesn’t show up to your workouts with support and comfort, you can bet your bottom dollar you’re in for red marks and a sore back.</p>
<p>That said, wearing the right sports bra is more than just a cute design. The goal is to find a sports bra that works with your body, not against it, as gravity and motion are already doing so.</p>
<p>From running to box jumps, HIIT to jumping rope, the bra you choose to support your chest, makes all the difference in each and every workout.</p>
<h3>The Job Description of a Good Sports Bra</h3>
<p>A sports bra serves a few purposes, “To support the breasts for high impact movement so they are not moving around too much and feel uncomfortable, and to provide moisture wicking so that you can work out and not become too hot and sweaty,” says Theresa Marko, board-certified clinical specialist in orthopaedic physical therapy, and CEO and owner of <a href="https://www.markophysicaltherapy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marko Physical Therapy</a>.</p>
<p>The right sports bra should also provide <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/how-keep-your-thoracic-spine-healthy-and-relieve-back-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support to your back (thoracic spine)</a>, via the compression it gives to your upper torso. “One needs to feel comfortable and supported so that they can focus on their exercise and or activity, and not be preoccupied with how their body is feeling uncomfortable,” says Marko. In short, a sports bra needs to: support, wick sweat, comfortably compress, and feel good on your body.</p>
<p>Because sports bra sizing is inconsistent across different brands, following these tips, (along with trying on several different sports bras) will help you narrow down the best-fitting sports bra for you!</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Women-trying-on-different-sports-bras.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Women trying on different sports bras" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Women-trying-on-different-sports-bras.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">puhhha/Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure>
<h3>How to Find the Best Sports Bra for Your Body</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sizing matters:</strong> Getting the correct size is very important. “Measure the width of your chest under the breasts to know how many inches this is,” explains Marko. This measurement is the traditional “34, 36, 38” etc. in bra sizes. It will be helpful to know for sports bras as well. Sports bras can go by cup sizing like traditional bras or they can go by an S, M, L, or XL sizing. “If it goes by the letter sizing, there will generally be a fit guide with the inches around the chest to match the sizing, Marko says. That said, it’s best to use a tape measure to find your true chest size.</li>
<li><strong>Consider the activity for compression needs:</strong> Different activities require different compression levels. “Do you want high compression (think tight for jumping and running), medium compression (think going to the gym), or low compression (think relaxing at home or doing some yoga)?” Marko asks. “Most stores now like Gap, Athleta, Lululemon have the high-compression, medium-compression, to low-compression sports bras so you can choose the one that is right for you,” she says</li>
<li><strong>Material: I</strong>n considering the materials, (besides compression), think of the fabric feel. “Do you want the elastic stretch, do you want the smooth silky second-skin feel, or do you want the gentle cotton feel?” asks Marko. Being comfortable in your bra via the material is just as important as the other job requirements of a good sports bra.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Sweat-wicking material is a bonus as well: If you’re going to sweat, go for a material that shows up to work and fights moisture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strap style:</strong> There are as many strap styles as there are bras today—which is a good thing. Trying on a variety of bras with varied strap styles will help you gauge what works best for you. Opting for adjustable straps is a no-brainer as it allows you to adjust to your individual body. “Consider how the straps will make your neck feel,” Marko says Will the straps dig in? “Think of your shoulder and neck health,” she encourages.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Although the crisscross style straps do feel very supportive as this type of sports bra holds you snuggly in, Marko warns that “something to consider with this type of bra is that you definitely don’t want it too tight because the straps can dig into your muscles in your neck (upper traps) and feel really uncomfortable, causing pain, and possibly headaches.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider Shoulder Health:</strong> If you have shoulder problems like impingement or have had trauma at the shoulders, Marko suggests that “perhaps you need a sports bra that opens to the front so that you do not have to contort your shoulder in a weird way which might aggravate it.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">The same applies to those who have larger breasts – an open-in-the-front bra makes it easier getting putting on and taking off.</p>
<p>The easiest way to find a sports bra that best suits your body and activity is, once you know your size and are ready to buy, take your time trying a variety of brands one. Move freely in them, stretch, do a few jumping jacks, anything that will let you know this is the fit for you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Dwayne Johnson finally unleashes Black Adam on the movie going public with an official release this coming Friday, M&F was given a sneak-peek screening of the blockbuster, with an estimated $200 million budget, to see if “The People’s Champion” showed up worthy of being “Kahndaq’s Champion.” We soon found out that that DJ can more than <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/active-lifestyle/theres-scientific-reason-we-all-love-superheroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hang with the rest of the DC Universe</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, Johnson has shown that success is all in the commitment and preparation. This was never in doubt, as months prior to the movie’s release, the stars’ personal trainer, <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/interviews/dave-rienzi-talks-biomechanics-and-sculpting-those-scene-ready-physiques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Rienzi had told us</a> that no stone was left unturned in an effort to make “The Great One” look like a superhuman without the need for a bulked out costume to give the illusion of serious muscle mass. Rienzi noted that as part of their rounded approach to training, work had even been done to correct Johnson’s neuromuscular patterns so that they could get the best technique and form from every workout. It seems that the level of detail that the duo put into getting the former <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/10-wwe-superstars-who-became-movie-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE champion into DC shape</a> more than hit the mark, and thanks to routines that included sets of four exercises, executing as many reps as he could with flies, chest presses and bodyweight dips, plus miles and miles of height attained on the stepper, this may be the most ripped incarnation of a comic book character we’ve seen since Dolph Lundgren’s 1987 portrayal of He-Man, or Arnie’s legendary outings as Conan.</p>

<h3>Dwayne Johnson was Driven, Disciplined, and Determined to do Justice to Black Adam</h3>
<p>“… when you have someone like DJ who is so driven, disciplined, and determined to do the work. There’s a continuously evolving vision that we are always working towards.” Said Rienzi of the grueling but ultimately rewarding process. “We’ve been building up to the Black Adam movie for a while, with this goal of creating a real-life superhero physique… with no padded superhero suit necessary.” Indeed, this would have needed to be a careful process of making sure that Johnson is screen-ready at all times, without over taxing his body to the point that it had a negative impact on his other projects. The results? Move over “Man of Steel” because Black Adam has “Quads of Granite!” The current King of the Box Office does not disappoint, and the movie looks set to fly too, with an estimated take of $75 million in the opening weekend.</p>
<p>As expected, The Rock brings his unique, if somewhat consciously controlled, level charisma to a complex role, playing an anti-hero who is freed from his earthly tomb to unleash the almighty powers of the ancient gods. It may not be high-brow enough for some movie critics, but we’ll take “The People’s Eyebrow” any time, and with out-of-this-world special effects and some thunderous action, Johnson more than packs a punch, finally electrifying his fans with literal bolts of lightning too!</p>
<p>At 69-years-young, the ever-svelte Pierce Brosnan’s portrayal of Doctor Fate also deserves a special nod for setting up some of Black Adam’s most comedic dialogue, as the two alpha’s exhibit great chemistry on screen. Of course, with any movie in this genre, a large part of the enjoyment comes speculating on what the future may hold for this area of the DC Universe, and there is plenty to go at here. With Black Adam having a history of violence in the comic books, a ferocious tone needed to come through with the movie and thankfully, with Johnson’s incredible presentation and innate understanding of physicality, the movie was able to achieve this tone without watering things down too much for those who set the film’s rating. For his part, DJ exudes everything that you would expect from a superhuman: confidence, intensity, and intelligence. Perhaps gracing the screen as his most muscular since appearing in the Fast & Furious Franchise, Johnson is now leaner, and even when you take away the tight-fitting rubber suit or the magic of CGI, there’s no escaping the size of <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/athletecelebrity-workouts/train-rock-dwayne-johnsons-shoulder-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The Great One’s” shoulders and traps</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson is on record as hinting that he would love for Black Adam to take on Superman, and he seems intent on expanding Black Adam’s DC footprint. Could we see Superman, or Batman receiving a smackdown? With this initial movie proving that Black Adam is a much-needed shot in the arm for DC fans, the mere thought of Dwayne Johnson versus Henry Cavill conjures up mental images of what could be the most anticipated battle in action movie history. Shazam!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you want to improve the way you look, move, training efficiency, and the ability to lift more weight, supersets are the bomb. You can <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/opposites-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pair almost any exercise together to build muscle</a>, lose fat or bring up a lagging body part. You’ll do more work in less time and hit the showers early while the gym bunnies are busy taking their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gymselfieshoutouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram selfies</a>. Who’s got time for Instagram anyway <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/20-unwritten-gym-rules-you-must-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when seeking a muscle pump</a>? The bottom line is that if supersets are not part of your workout program, you’re missing out on gains.</p>
<p>Here is the lowdown on supersets, why they should be a regular part of your workout, and four superset types to take your training to the next level. Ready to get better? Then let’s go.</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE SUPERSETS?</h3>
<p>Supersets are when you perform two exercises back to back, followed by a short rest. This effectively doubles the amount of work you do while improving your training efficiency. Because you’ll keep the same recovery periods between exercises in a superset as when you do straight sets.</p>
<p>In a program, supersets often look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1A.</strong> Bench Press 8-12 reps</li>
<li><strong>1B.</strong> Chin Ups 8-12 reps</li>
<li>Rest 60-90 seconds and repeat 3-4 times</li>
</ul>
<h3>ADVANTAGES OF SUPERSETS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increase the efficiency of your workout because you’re reducing the rest periods between exercises. Making sure you have all the equipment you need beforehand works best.</li>
<li>Reducing your rest periods between exercises will increase the intensity of your training, and this leads to better results.</li>
<li>Increased muscle building and fat loss potential because the shorter rest periods and back-to-back muscle contractions in supersets can help promote an additional stimulus for muscle growth.</li>
<li>Increased fat loss because of the reasons above when you use supersets in combination with a caloric deficit.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sept. 28, 2022, President Joe Biden hosted the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. The president and his administration established five pillars to define the scope of the goals to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/14-best-things-you-can-do-your-body/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve the overall health and wellness</a> of the citizens of the United States.</p>
<p>Aside from the president himself, there were several speakers who offered their thoughts and expertise on the matters at hand. Among those was Kari Miller-Ortiz, who serves as the director of people and culture at Move United. Move United works to get people more active in sports, regardless of ability. Miller-Ortiz expressed that the moment was unsettling because of the changes in both her speech and the time she had allotted to speak.</p>
<p>“I’m not the type to say no, so I was like, ‘OK, I will do this.’”</p>
<p>Miller-Ortiz rose to the occasion and represented her organization and the American people well. Most people would’ve found that situation as a challenging form of adversity to get through, but Miller-Ortiz has done that a lot, and she’s been through greater forms of adversity than speaking publicly. The United States Army veteran had prepared for such when she made the decision to <a href="https://www.usa.gov/join-military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join the military</a>. The inspiration from that came from within her family members such as her single mom who worked as a detective, and her aunt who had served in the Army during Operation Desert Storm.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want [her mom] to have to pay for college,” said Miller-Ortiz. “The opportunity showed itself and I joined the Army.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her career ambitions in the Army came to a halt in 1999. She had been on missions in places such as Bosnia when she came home for the holidays. While on leave and out with friends, she was in a car accident with a drunk driver.</p>
<p>“I remember being in the car and not knowing what was going on. I felt like something was squeezing my chest, but I couldn’t see anything.”</p>
<p>A utility pole had fallen on top of the car. When the paramedics showed up, they cut the top of the car off. They then determined there was only one way to get Miller-Ortiz out of the vehicle—amputate both of her legs.</p>
<p>“I told the guy that if he had to cut my legs off, I’d forgive him. Just get me out of here. So, they knocked me out and cut my legs off right there on the scene.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Army-veteran-Kari-Miller-Ortiz-laying-in-a-hospital-bed.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Army veteran Kari Miller-Ortiz laying in a hospital bed" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Army-veteran-Kari-Miller-Ortiz-laying-in-a-hospital-bed.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Kari Miller-Ortiz</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A helicopter would take Miller-Ortiz to a local hospital. Her mother was initially told that she actually died in the accident. When her aunt was told that news, Miller-Ortiz said she knew better.</p>
<p>“She was like, ‘No, I don’t believe it,’” Miller-Ortiz recalled. “She gets in the car, leaves, drives to the hospital, saw me, and then called my mom and said, ‘Nope, she’s here.’”</p>
<p>The driver of the car Miller-Ortiz was in passed away, another passenger suffered <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/how-keep-your-thoracic-spine-healthy-and-relieve-back-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back and neck injuries</a>, and another passenger escaped unharmed. Miller-Ortiz found her way to move forward, and she credited her family for helping her during that period of her life, including her mother, aunt, and uncle.</p>
<p>She found another way to move forward through sports and fitness. She described herself as a kid as a tom-boy, and mentioned she played football with the boys in her neighborhood streets, and she has the proof to go along with it.</p>
<p>“I have all kinds of injuries and leftover scars from that,” she stated proudly. “I played basketball as well. I was pretty much a jock.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kari-Miller-Ortiz-on-a-volleyball-court.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kari Miller-Ortiz on a volleyball court" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kari-Miller-Ortiz-on-a-volleyball-court.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Kari Miller-Ortiz</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Miller-Ortiz lives with prosthetic legs, but she was offered a chance to try playing wheelchair basketball. She didn’t feel comfortable at first because she does walk, but she eventually gave it a try, and she was humbled quickly.</p>
<p>“I grew up playing basketball, so I thought I was a baller. I rolled up to shoot a free throw, and that ball went nowhere. This little girl scooped it up, went in and scored a layup.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Miller-Ortiz fell in love with the sport, and she kept playing. She improved tremendously and went on to play at the college level for the University of Illinois. Miller-Ortiz was even granted an opportunity to try out for Team USA in 2007.</p>
<p>“You have to be the best of the best to get that opportunity,” she shared. “I was like, ‘Heck, yeah!’”</p>
<p>Miller-Ortiz gave her best, but she wasn’t selected to make the team. She then moved on to wheelchair volleyball, and that is where she would see her greatest success as an athlete. After going to Atlanta to try playing for the first time, she started working with coach Michael Hulett, who was also a quad-amputee. He had no hands or legs.</p>
<p>“At one time, he was one of the top volleyball players in the world. He was amazing,” said Miller-Ortiz. She admitted to never playing volleyball before, but she went to try for the Paralympics anyway. She missed the cut on her first try, but she made the team on her next attempt. The success just grew from there.</p>
<p>“I was named Best Defensive Specialist in the world,” she said. Her team won silver at the 2007 Paralympic Games, and would continue earning bronze and silver medals over the years since. She was also named Paralympian of the Year in 2009. Her career highlight came in 2016 when her team won gold at the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Her team were invited to the White House, where President Barack Obama spoke about her.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Army-veteran-Kari-Miller-Ortiz-with-her-husband-on-the-basketball-court.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Army veteran Kari Miller-Ortiz with her husband on the basketball court" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Army-veteran-Kari-Miller-Ortiz-with-her-husband-on-the-basketball-court.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Kari Miller-Ortiz</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While she was playing, Miller-Ortiz also found another way to serve her country and support the military. She started working with the US Paralympic Military program, where she started new programs for injured servicemembers at Walter Reed, Bethesda Naval, and Fort Belvoir. She also made her way into coaching, by serving as a sitting volleyball coach for Army and Air Force teams for wounded, ill and injured athletes.</p>
<p>“That community is often overlooked,” she explained. Move United is the largest adaptive organization in America. Their mission is to help individual with disabilities are given opportunities to participate in sports. Miller-Ortiz can relate to the people she serves both as an adaptive citizen and a sports enthusiast. One of her missions is to increase awareness of adaptive sports and share the opportunities to participate that people may not know about.</p>
<p>“Ninety percent of all Americans can participate in an adaptive sport within 50 miles of their home,” she revealed.</p>
<p>Between her personal experience, her athletic accomplishments, and her professional service, Miller-Ortiz has made many great strides in helping adaptive athletes and even beginners learn more about themselves and feel the same sense of community. She expressed pride in being a part of the adaptive community, and she has connections that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>“With me being an adult and some of these kids being 16, some being from Kansas, some being from Hawaii or other places, there’s no way I would’ve had a shared experience with these people that I do today. However, now that I’ve gone through that, I have weddings and kids to buy gifts for. It’s a family.” For more information on Move United, go to <a href="http://www.moveunitedsport.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.moveunitedsport.org</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When an IFBB Pro League competitor takes a stage, he or she is announced by name along with their home country. The athletes consider it an honor to represent their homeland while living their dreams competing around the world. Biki Singh is very familiar with that feeling as the first Classic Physique pro to come from India. He is a significant part of <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/ifbb/9-strongest-bodybuilders-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bodybuilding history</a> in his part of the world.</p>
<p>Clearly, Biki SIngh wants to represent his home nation well when he steps onstage, and he thinks about that each time he poses in a show, which makes him a perfect candidate to answer questions about posing for both amateurs and pros. M&F Social Media Director Frank Sepe found those questions in the <em>M&F</em> DMs, and he posed those questions to Singh in a recent Q&A session from Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym in Syosset, NY.</p>

<p><strong>How often do you pose and how do you pick your posing music?</strong></p>
<p>This posing room is my second gym this because this is a work of thing. When I work out, I do it as a pose. You will come here is easy to pose because that’s what Kai Greene told me. he’s posing onstage. So, he practiced that everywhere—when he drove and when he did other kinds of stuff, you know, it comes naturally when making (it) a life. You have to do practice every single day, not just at the gym. It’s not just one hour thing here. <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/bodybuilding-competition-the-posing-rounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bodybuilding is posing</a>, it is all one thing, and you have to live this.</p>
<p>For the posing music, I go by the beats more than the lyrics. So, I don’t care like what the lyrics is. I choose the music that I love because posing is not what someone can teach you. It should come out automatically. The flow is like a dance.</p>
<p><strong>What was the last song you used?</strong></p>
<p>It is Punjabi because that’s what I listen to. I listen to Punjabi music so that is what I use. I’m trying to find a Punjabi song that Snoop Dogg had done. You gotta go resonate with the feel of the song.</p>
<p>If you pick one of the trendy songs in the United States, one of the songs you have to jam the song, you’re not going to have the same effect on you as far as, even mentally.</p>
<p>Punjabi music is what I grew up with. So, I put my headphones on, and that music is what lifts me up. The religion that moves the culture and everything, I have to find that in the music and I find that’s important. Because bro bodybuilding, is something that allows you to do anything in this world. The music world view is everything. I make sure you know whatever I do is all connected and I find connections.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re 10 weeks out for a show, how often would you come in the posing room and pose?</strong></p>
<p>I come in here every single day. At lease for five to 10 minutes, I’m coming in here to pose. This is not just a workout for me, it’s meditation.</p>
<p>It’s funny you say that because when I go to Hot Yoga and you wear shorts and nothing else to talk about 160 degrees, looking in the mirror keeps you accountable. So, when you’re coming in here in the offseason, you’re seeing yourself, are you like “I gotta kick it back a little I gotta do more cardio” because you don’t seem to be a person who likes to be out of shape.</p>
<p>I’m never out of shape, because my coach told me he taught me is if you lose your abs during the offseason, you’re not a bodybuilder, okay. A little fat here and there is okay, but I make sure I still have my abs and my striations in my quads. They are always there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hilarious and sometimes excruciating “WHACKED OUT” franchise has been <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-routines/top-10-workout-fails-all-time-funny-video-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighting epic fails</a> and massive mishaps since 2006, spawning spinoffs such as “Monster Knockout” and “Sports Crash,” and is set to make a big return to TV screens next year with pro wrestler, Jessie Godderz in the hosting role.</p>
<p>M&F caught up with the multi-talented star who weighs in at 200 pounds to find out how his training is going, and what crazy antics make him laugh at the gym.</p>
<p>The man they understandably call “Mr PEC-Tacular” first appeared under the spotlight when he became a bodybuilder, soon <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/9-wwe-superstars-training-secrets-and-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transitioning as a fulltime pro wrestler</a> and grappling for the likes of Impact Wrestling, Wrestle-1, Lucha Underground, and Ohio Valley Wrestling, where he has currently settled. Along the way, he also found fame as a reoccurring presence on “Big Brother.” There’s no doubt that gaining television experience on CBS would help Godderz to develop his character as well as his body.</p>
<p>“I now hold the record of having more annual appearances on “Big Brother” than any other houseguest in the show’s illustrious history,” he says. “The network and the producers of the show genuinely liked the appearances so much, and they ended up being so successful, that they kept bringing me back to pop a rating. Many of my appearances were among Big Brother’s highest rated episodes of the season!” Indeed, as Godderz profile as an internationally known pro wrestler grew, his BB appearances would later evolve from that of a regular contestant to featured special guest spots, putting him in the middle of team tasks such as “Dunk a Hunk” and “Space PECS” and revealing his chiseled physique at every opportunity… of course!</p>
<h3>Jesse Godderz is ‘All Business’ in the gym</h3>
<p>“I usually work out around five days per week,” says Godderz. “Each session takes approximately one hour. I try to go in and out without much rest between sets, to keep my heart rate up. I’m pretty much all business in the gym!” These days, Godderz is running the ropes for Ohio Valley Wrestling, a promotion that was once a developmental system for WWE but now stands independently and has a global following thanks to its presence on a variety of platforms including Fite.tv. While wrestling for OVW, the big man has won numerous titles, including the National Heavyweight title, and he doesn’t shy away from giving credit to his trainer and mentor, Al Snow. “I owe most of my success to the WWE legend,” says Godderz. “He is the best of the best. He trained me at OVW and made me into the world-class athlete I am today.”</p>
<p>At age 36, Godderz says he’s feeling better than ever before, and has a renewed sense of purpose in the gym, but perhaps in preparation for his upcoming hosting duties he’s beginning to notice gym failures more frequently.</p>

<h3>Jessie Godderz loves a trier</h3>
<p>In both his Big Brother and pro wrestling appearances, Godderz has learned to love the same style of self-depreciating humor that often airs on “WHACKED OUT” and feels that although we enjoy laughing at other people’s failures, we do so in a loving way because everyone loves a trier.</p>
<p>“To join in on the joke is the best type of humor of all,” he laughs. “I see guys in the gym let their egos get the best of them and try to max out on the bench with way too much weight on, and the bar doesn’t move more than an inch off their chest! It’s the same thing on deadlifts: I saw one guy try to lift 495 pounds off the ground recently and the weight didn’t budge…so he literally stood there for what seemed like five minutes to try to move that thing. He put chalk on his hands, but it didn’t work. He then had a buddy hit him on the back to psyche him up and that didn’t work. Undeterred, he put on his headphones with the music blaring so loud that I could hear it 10 feet away. Guess what? That still didn’t work. It was ridiculous. I’m laughing right now just thinking about it. I imagine that ego lifting is the root cause of most gym fails!”</p>
<p>With the return of “WHACKED OUT” due sometime next year, Mr PEC-Tacular is still banging heads in the OVW ring, and even has a comic book bearing his likeness on the way. So, is there anything else on Godderz’s bucket list? “Working again with the<a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/training-tips-2011-mr-olympia-phil-heath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> seven-time Mr Olympia, Phil Heath</a>,” he shares. <em>FLEX</em> magazine readers will recall images of Heath celebrating inside the ring with Godderz and his tag partner Robbie E (who is now Robert Stone in WWE) back in 2013, when they won Impact tag team championship. “I hope to bring Phil into OVW at some point. He’d make an excellent professional wrestler! He’s an icon in bodybuilding and I know he could become one in wrestling as well. My tag team partner Robbie and I called him our Big Bro, and we still do.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IFBB Pro League Women’s Bodybuilder Chelsea Dion is currently riding a great wave of momentum. She won the 2022 Tampa Pro earlier this year, and is now qualified to compete in the 2022 Ms. Olympia, where she will stand alongside the best in the world in Las Vegas, Nevada on the weekend of Dec. 16-18.</p>
<p>Dion is clearly happy about this, but she’s also grateful because she is aware that the situation could be much different for her. In December 2019, she was riding with friends when they were in a head-on collision with a Lyft. Obviously, she survived, but she didn’t go through it unscaved.</p>
<p>“I had a concussion, some (other) issues, but mainly, it just takes your body so long to recover from that impact,” Dion told Alina Popa and Lenda Murray on a recent episode of Femme Flex Friday. “I felt like I was hit by a truck for a couple of weeks.”</p>
<p>The toll wasn’t just physical, it was mental as well. Dion revealed that she went into a depression in the aftermath of the accident.</p>
<p>“When training is your outlet for everything, and then you can’t do that, it really, really affected me mentally,” Dion said. “I remember sleeping for 19 hours every day. I couldn’t get out of bed.”</p>
<p>It took time, but Dion is on the other side of it now, and she’s excited to step onto the Olympia stage. She did share why she felt she was able to overcome the adversity that she’s faced along the way.</p>
<p>“It’s all for a bigger purpose. I 100 percent believe that the universe provides, and I believe it will continue to provide for me as long as I continue being a good person, I continue spreading positivity, and just being a positive light.”</p>
<p>Dion shared more about her childhood, entry into bodybuilding, her mindset when she took the stage in Tampa, and a lot more. Go to www.wingsofstrength.net to see this and all episodes of Femme Flex Friday. New shows air every Friday at 6 PM Eastern time. You can also watch by subscribing to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/wingsofstrength">Wings of Strength YouTube channel</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dorian Yates was the standard-bearer in bodybuilding for the majority of the 1990’s. He is the only British Mr. Olympia winner, having held the title from 1992 to 1997. 25 years after his retirement from the sport, Yates is still considered a legend.</p>
<p>Yates joined fellow ’90s bodybuilders Milos Sarcev, Dennis James and Chris Cormier on a recent episode of “The Menace Podcast,” and the group started discussing Yates training principles that led to his success. Yates expressed that his Blood & Guts training, which were short and intense sessions was all he needed to make improvements and have quality training sessions both in the offseason as well as during his contest prep.</p>
<p>“Four days a week was the maximum,” Yates told James. “I never trained for more than an hour.”</p>
<p>James followed up with another question for “The Shadow.” Would he change anything now that he knows about the injuries that he suffered leading to his eventual retirement in 1998?</p>
<p>“Ultimately, no, because I am where I am and I’m happy, and everything that happened before brought me to this place.”</p>
<p>In recent years, Yates has been using his philosophies to coach and train other bodybuilders as well as average gym goers and even beginners who never trained before. Yates reported that his principles have been successful across the board.</p>
<p>“The training is relative to the person. So, if you’ve never done one pushup in your life, even bench pressing five-pound dumbbells is going to be intense enough,” he said. “I’ve turned people’s health around in just a month.”</p>
<p>Yates went on to express that isn’t just about training. How it is done matters too. Yates recalled how he told Cormier about adjustments that made a world of difference for him when they trained together.</p>
<p>“It’s the little details about how you lift the weight, and how you control the weight. Which path is it taking? How you control the negative on the way down, and it’s little thing after little thing after little thing. All those little things add up to a big thing.”</p>
<p>The discussion went into greater depths and even included a debate between Sarcev and Yates about the science of training. See the episode for yourself to subscribing to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwi9teS8XW21G3hhct5SJgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muscle & Fitness YouTube channel</a>. You can see future episodes every Sunday at 3 PM Eastern time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the career aspirations of American tennis star Taylor Fritz was accomplished earlier this month when he won the Japan Open.</p>
<p>Fritz claimed his third title of the year and moved into the Top 10 in the Pepperstone ATP Rankings. He became the first American player to break into the Top 10 since 2017. Making the win and accomplished milestone more impressive is that Fritz was fresh off of a week-long quarantine in South Korea after contracting COVID-19. He arrived in Tokyo on the day of his first match.</p>
<p>Ahead of competing in the Stockholm Open this week, Fritz unpacked his training gear for <em>Muscle and Fitness</em> and dished on the importance of training and supplements along with sharing some of the great tennis gear and recovery equipment he carries with him at all times as he looks for a fourth win in 2022.</p>

<p><strong>What would you recommend for someone trying to tighten up their midsection?</strong></p>
<p>So, the secret to a small midsection? One, I would say checking digestion. Any type of food that makes you inflamed, bloated, try to stay away from them.</p>
<p>Drink a lot of water Keep yourself hydrated in all possible ways. If you don’t like water, just squeeze it piece of lemon in it. They also have little single crystal light. Just drink a lot of water. I drink personally a gallon of water a day at least.</p>
<p>Third, and most important of all, sleep. Sleep is very important and it does make the trip for your midsection and it does make the trick for your midsection.</p>
<p>Of course, keeping a clean diet with clean ingredients that makes your body work, your body feel good. And then you can add crunches and training, but most of all 80% of the job is really hydration, sleep and the food keeping yourself away from food that gets bloated and keeping a clean and healthy diet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2022 Boston Pro Wellness winner Yarishna Ayala is one of the most popular athletes in her division. That means she has quite a hectic schedule between making appearances and preparing for the 2022 Olympia this December in Las Vegas, Nevada. Ayala told Fit Rockstar host Isabelle Turell that while she stays busy, it’s worth the grind.</p>
<p>“I love competing, but more I love helping other people,” said the former New York Pro winner. “For me, this is my favorite part because it’s amazing for me to just do that for the people.”</p>
<p>Ayala sees her efforts as her doing her part to make the Wellness division grow. It has already gained a lot of popularity in a short time, but she evens even more potential in the future.</p>
<p>“You still don’t see too many girls competing. So, I’m working for that growing.”</p>
<p>Ayala has worked with several ladies that have had apprehensions to compete because of the quality of athletes, but her advice to them is to go all in anyway. If nothing else, they can reach their full potential by giving their best.</p>
<p>“Just focus on yourself and what you need to improve to be the best. You don’t care if this other person competes or not,” she told Turell. That philosophy is one that she also applies to herself, which is why she is considered a contender for the 2022 Wellness Olympia title. Ayala is drawing from her 2021 Olympia experience to help her prepare for the contest this year.</p>
<p>“It was an amazing experience. I was always dreaming of competing in the Olympia, but this year, I think I’m more focused. I know what to expect. I know what I need to do to be the best at this year’s Olympia.”</p>
<p>Turell and Ayala covered a lot of ground in this episode, including her clothing line, stories from her travels around the world, and more. Subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/wingsofstrength" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wings of Strength YouTube channel</a> so you can catch every episode of the Fit Rockstar Show every Saturday at 12 noon Eastern time.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 100th episode of The Menace Podcast was a star-studded affair. Host Dennis James was joined by a variety of bodybuilding legends and gurus, including Prime Time Muscle co-host Chris Cormier, Milos Sarcev, George Farah, Chris Aceto, Chad Nicholls, and yes, Lee Priest.</p>
<p>In traditional Menace form, DJ didn’t beat around the bush when it came to putting the guests on the spot. He asked each guest to give his Mr. Olympia top six predictions at the 9.5 week out mark. Aceto left the chat before this segment, but Farah offered a top six, but didn’t elaborate on positioning.</p>
<p>“The top ten will be Ramy, Andrew (Jacked), Brandon (Curry), Blessing (Awodibu), Hadi (Choopan), (William) Bonac,” Farah said like he was doing a roll-call. Sarcev was up next, and he didn’t hesitate on his picks at all.</p>
<p>“Ramy, Hadi, Samson, Brandon, Bonac, and Andrew,” he said clearly. Nicholls had to take time to think about it, except who the champion will be because he coaches the current Mr. Olympia, Big Ramy.</p>
<p>“I know both of my guys, Ramy and Bonac, are going to be in the top six,” Nicholls said. “I’ve got Nick Walker in the top six, I’ve got Andrew Jacked in the top six, Hadi, and Hunter,” he said while making note that 2019 Mr. Olympia Brandon Curry is out of his top six. “I think Brandon falls this year.”</p>
<p>Cormier was up next, and he went with Elssbiay, Jacked, Labrada, Bonac, Choopan, and Curry for his top six. Priest followed with Elssbiay, Bonac, Dauda, Jacked, Choopan, and Curry if he comes in good condition. His alternate outside of Curry was Walker.</p>
<p>James observed the variety of pics from each guest, and he also noticed that there was little certainty.</p>
<p>“If I asked you again in an hour, it may change,” he said. He then offered his own predictions.</p>
<p>“Ramy, Bonac, Curry, Hadi, Nick Walker, and Derek (Lunsford), DJ stated. He followed up that his predictions were in no particular order, and he was also the only one to mention the former Olympia 212 champion.</p>
<p>The 100th episode of TMP can be seen in its entirety on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwi9teS8XW21G3hhct5SJgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muscle & Fitness YouTube channel</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Some gyms are more inspirational than others,” says Mark Rhino Smith. American Gladiators was a big success on television in the US. But many Americans are not aware that versions of this program were produced in a variety of other countries, also with great success and producing several <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/news/10-best-movie-physiques-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stars who became athletic celebrities</a>.</p>
<p>One of the stars of “Gladiators” in the United Kingdom was a bodybuilder named Mark Smith, who was known on the TV show as “Rhino”. Rhino was the nickname the boys in <a href="https://muscleworksgym.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muscleworks gym in London</a> gave him in 1989 before winning the Junior U21’s British Championships. “I was a serious, competitive bodybuilder,” Mark says, “and managed to put on quite a lot of size. But for the very real athletic demands of being a Gladiator, being lean helps in terms of speed, agility, and overall performance. So, I realized that the kind of extreme mass that allows for success in bodybuilding was not really called for, given the various athletic events in Gladiators. So, I changed my training and dieting accordingly.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_1147726" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Smith.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Mark Smith" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Smith.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="caption">Mark Rhino Smith at his biggest</span> <span class="credit">Mark Smith</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“I was seriously into bodybuilding. I wanted to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/dorian-yates-advice-aspiring-bodybuilders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be another Dorian Yates</a> or Ronnie Coleman. But although I made progress and won some titles as a heavyweight, I began to suspect I might not have won the “genetic lottery” that would allow me to go all the way as a pro bodybuilder. The difference between the winner of a Formula I race and second place can be as little as 1/100 of a second. In bodybuilding, that difference can be just one element of the metabolism or the length of a muscle belly. Small differences can make winning extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Plus, I discovered as any committed bodybuilder realizes, that competing at high levels involves a great deal of sacrifice. Everything else in your life must take second place – work, relationships, everything. When you are 18 years old that kind of sacrifice looks different than it does when you are 10 years older.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_1147725" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Smith2.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Mark Smith2" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Smith2.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="caption">Boxing prepared me for contact both mentally and physically.</span> <span class="credit">Mark Smith</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Mark Smith got the opportunity to try out as a Gladiator, he had some advantages. “I had been a boxer and won four bouts. The importance of this is that, while the Gladiator program is a show, it is also a very intense form of combat. You have people crashing into you and not everybody is able to take that kind of contact and survive both physically and mentally. There have been a lot of Gladiators injured just preparing for Gladiator tryouts. Not everybody is able to survive and thrive when it comes to physical combat.”</p>
<p>Performing in one event after another is also tiring. But Mark says at one point he ran several marathons. So, he was no stranger to extended and exhausting physical effort. While others would tire over time, Mark was the “energizer bunny” and just kept going. “If you can’t out-muscle competitors,” he says, “sometimes you just have to out-last them!”</p>
<figure id="attachment_1147724" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Rhino-Smith-Gladiator.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Mark Rhino Smith-Gladiator" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Rhino-Smith-Gladiator.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="caption">Bodybuilding prepared Mark” Rhino” Smith for being a Gladiator.</span> <span class="credit">Mark Smith</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mark Rhino Smith was not often outmuscled. He got a lot lighter and leaner to be a Gladiator, but he had been a powerful heavyweight bodybuilder, used to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/confirmed-lifting-heavy-best-way-get-stronger-and-save-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using massive weights in exercises</a> like bench presses, deadlifts, and squats. Any competitors who tried to go head-to-head with him based on pure strength were likely to be surprised and disappointed.</p>
<p>Anyway, one thing led to another when it came to Mark Smith’s career. Bodybuilding prepared him for being a Gladiator and getting lean and mean for that motivated him to slim down and develop more muscularity, which perfectly prepared him for an acting career.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1147723" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Smith-Cowboy.jpg?w=200&quality=86&strip=all" alt="Mark Smith-Cowboy" width="200" height="111" data-fallback-img="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Smith-Cowboy.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="caption">Mark Smith is in costume for the movie,” The Harder They Fall”</span> <span class="credit">Mark Smith</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“Everybody has heard that the camera ads weight to your appearance,” Mark says. “And that’s true. Look at Sylvester Stallone in Rocky. He played a heavyweight while he was barely even a light-heavyweight. But he was so defined and muscular that he came across as much bigger than he really was. When you are big and smooth on film, sometimes you just come across as a large lump.”</p>
<p>Mark “Rhino” Smith was born in London and has a hugely colorful heritage – Jamaican, Cherokee Indian, White, and Chinese. “In this age of international jet travel,” Mark says, “ethnic mixture is becoming more and more common. Just look at somebody like The Rock.” Mark starred in the IVT Gladiator series for five years, which led to other acting gigs and finally relocation to Los Angeles as an actor and producer. “I have been fortunate to appear in Creed, Criminal Minds, and other movies and TV shows. But I have always stayed aware that what got me here was my body and my ability to train to be aesthetically muscular.”</p>

<p>“I really enjoyed shooting photos in the legendary Gold’s Gym in Venice,” he says. “I grew up reading magazines like Muscle & Fitness and Flex and seeing all my idols and role models working out in the gym. I think a good bodybuilder should be able to train in any properly equipped gym but there is no double that some environments are more inspiring and stimulating than others.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IFBB Pro Women’s bodybuilder Cheryl Mears has competed as both an Open and Master’s competitor since turning pro in 2018. She has also competed in Women’s Physique in her career. She has extensive stage experience, but she is considered a walking bodybuilding miracle because of the adversity she has overcome in her life.</p>
<p>Mears confirmed to Isabelle Turell that she is a five-year survivor of cancer, and she even had a brush with death in the early stages of the pandemic in 2020, but not because of Covid. She had to be rushed to an emergency room due to a stomach issue.</p>
<p>“What technically happened was my intestines were twisting,” said Mears. “Once they twist, you can’t untwist them. You have to remove it. There’s no other way around it.”</p>
<p>At one point during her hospital stay, she overheard someone behind her say that she wouldn’t make it through the night. She told Turell that she reached for her phone and heard her daughter talking to her, but she couldn’t see the phone.</p>
<p>“My body was close to death. Everything was failing.”</p>
<p>After her daughter tried to reassure her that she would be okay, Mears told her that she was a fighter and would get through it. That turned out to be what happened, but it was no easy journey to go through. Mears was motivated to recover not only for her daughter, but for her return to the stage as well.</p>
<p>“It was that mindset that I truly believe helped me get through that situation,” she suggested. Mears would return to the stage by 2021, and she recently competed at the 2022 Lenda Murray Savannah Pro, which Turell also competed in. Mears had to wear a bag on her stomach while she competed, but she was there posing as she was before her ordeal began.</p>
<p>“I just can’t say enough about that show. It was really great.”</p>
<p>Mears shares a lot more about the journey and career that led Turell to call her “The Walking Miracle.” To see this episode as well as Turell’s other great interviews from The Fit Rockstar Show, go to <a href="http://www.wingsofstrength.net">www.wingsofstrength.net</a> or subscribe to the Wings of Strength YouTube channel.
